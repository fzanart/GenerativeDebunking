"“there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought”","I would like to add that this “twice as fast” is just for a cherry-picked period. That is about as bad as mitigation sceptics claiming that global warming has stopped by cherry picking a specific period. The real message was that satellite upper air warming estimates are unreliable (still are), but seem to confirm what we know from the surface warming. This story was thus not alarming. If anything is was good news, it reduces uncertainties and as this uninhabitable-article already suggests: uncertainty is not our friend.",dev,cherry picking

"“In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.”","It depends on the type of event. heatwaves and extreme heat events have increased since at least the 1950s1. Though tropical cyclones and drought are a bit harder to analyse since natural climate variability also plays a large role. This means there may be a signal of change due to human activity, but is more difficult to measure, due to the noise of the natural variability of the climate. Also, “attribution” can be done for specific events. this basically compares how often an extreme event of a particular magnitude and duration occurs in climate model simulations both with and without human emissions of greenhouse gases. This was first done on the 2003 European heatwave2. So it can be done, but is heavily dependent to the event you analyse, the spacial scale on which it occurs, and even the climate model/s and experimental set up you use3 1- Perkins (2012) Increasing frequency, intensity and duration of observed global heatwaves and warm spells.

"“According to a recent National Economic Research Associates Economic Consulting study, the Paris Agreement could obliterate $3 trillion of GDP, 6.5 million industrial sector jobs and $7,000 in per capita household income from the American economy by 2040. Meeting the 2025 emissions reduction target alone could subtract $250 billion from our GDP and eliminate 2.7 million jobs. The cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining industries could see their production cut by 21% 19%, and 11% respectively.”","It is true that this is what the NERA study says, with many caveats. However, this statement is misleading and taken out of context. There are three reasons for this. First, and most importantly, the NERA study looked at the costs of a hypothetical set of policy actions. These may not be the actions that will be taken to comply with the Paris Agreement. One could easily model other actions with much lower costs. Second, it is only the costs that are modeled. The benefits from avoiding climate change (sea level rise, greater storm surges, greater spread of diseases, etc.) are entirely ignored. The net costs from the policies would be entirely different and likely even positive. Third, there is some cherry-picking going on here. The NERA model is known to be inflexible in how it allows for innovation to influence economic activity, and thus it tends to provide much higher cost estimates than other well-known models such as the U.S. Department of Energy’s NEMS or ICF Consulting’s IPM. The NERA model provides useful information, but it is important for it to be taken in context of model results from other models and not cherry-picked as was done here. ",dev,cherry picking
"“In pushing too hard for the case that global warming is universally bad for everything, the administration’s report undermines the reasonable case for climate action.”","As seems to always be the case with Lomborg (cf his previous WSJ’s article reviewed by Climate Feedback), he picks up a few studies that support his position. Note, first, that the report’s claim about projected heat-related deaths outweighing cold ones applies to the US: different regions might have different responses… Second, when reviewing the literature on the topic, the IPCC report indicates (WGIIAR5-Chap11, p.721): “it is not clear whether winter mortality will decrease in a warmer, but more variable, climate (Kinney et al., 2012; Ebi and Mills, 2013). Overall, we conclude that the increase in heat-related mortality by mid-century will outweigh gains due to fewer cold periods, especially in tropical developing countries with limited adaptive capacities and large exposed populations” So the US report does not appear wildly at odds with the literature on the topic, or to be “pushing too hard”. Also, it does not say that warming is universally bad, just that the bad outweighs the good on this particular topic.",dev,cherry picking

“The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades.”,"Yes, variability in California precipitation appears to have been higher in the past 3-4 decades than the previous decades, but it is not (and cannot be) clear that that the variability in precipitation is actually currently in the act of increasing. I say that it cannot be clear because it takes decades of data (say 2-3) to characterize the current “variability” of the climate. Based on my calculations, variability in annual precipitation totals increased considerably during the second half of the 1900s and then has remained at this relatively high level for the past couple decades, but has not clearly continued to increase. This latest swing from record dry to very wet in the last year is consistent with high variability, but it’s a single event and not necessarily indicative of a trend. There are some logical links, however, that support the inference that wild swings like the current one should be expected to become more likely. First, droughts are becoming increasingly impacted by warming temperatures. Even if precipitation behavior didn’t change at all, years with low precipitation would correspond to less and less water availability for humans and ecosystems. Second, current climate models project variability of California precipitation to increase in the future, with an increase in the frequency of years with very high precipitation totals becoming detectable sometime in the first half of this century, and an increase in the frequency of years with very low precipitation totals becoming detectable in the second half of this century*. It should always be remembered, however, that models have a tough time with California precipitation. California is right on the boundary between projections of drying to the south and wetting to the north. I personally believe the basic expectation that California precipitation should become more variable, but beyond that I don’t yet put much stock in what models have to say about the future of precipitation in California. So, variability has increased overall in the last century, and this is consistent with what models project to occur as a result of greenhouse-gas driven climate change. The increase in variability hasn’t been a monotonic trend, however, and it is not obvious from the data that the trend is continuing now as rapidly as it was in previous decades. This suggests that other low-frequency processes are also at play that influence decade-to-decade changes in the variability and magnitude of annual precipitation totals, making it particularly difficult to determine the degree to which this current event can be attributed to climate change. Nonetheless, California would be wise to prepare for more events like these.

It also is enhanced by increased nutrient delivery to the ocean from more rain and river flow on land under the warmer climate. More nutrients mean more algae growth in the uppermost ocean, more decaying organic matter below the surface, and thus less oxygen. Low oxygen zones would spread as the ocean became warmer and river flow increased as the event progressed. When oxygen is exhausted, bacteria do “breathe” other oxygen-containing compounds including sulfate and respire hydrogen sulfide. The coast of Namibia does experience these extreme conditions episodically, but such conditions are unlikely to spread globally until centuries to millennia of warming and eutrophication have occurred.

Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved.”","This is nonsense. No polar bear scientist has predicted a drop in polar bear abundance based on summer sea ice. We base the assessment of loss on duration of the ice-free period. Papers1,2 from our research group assess this point. The statement about global polar bear numbers is absolutely unfounded. It is a contrived statement using population estimates provided so that children (or the general public) could give a number of polar bears in the world for school reports and the like. Castro de la Guarida1 states, “Sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering physical characteristics of marine ecosystems. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have been identified as vulnerable to changes in sea ice conditions. We use sea ice projections for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from 2006 – 2100 to gain insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears with respect to habitat loss using metrics developed from polar bear energetics modeling. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Shifts away from multiyear ice to annual ice cover throughout the region, as well as lengthening ice-free periods, may become critical for polar bears before the end of the 21st century with projected warming. Each polar bear population in the Archipelago may undergo 2-5 months of ice-free conditions, where no such conditions exist presently. We identify spatially and temporally explicit ice-free periods that extend beyond what polar bears require for nutritional and reproductive demands. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under business-as-usual climate projections, polar bears may face starvation and reproductive failure across the entire Archipelago by the year 2100.” Both of these studies1,2 assess the threat to polar bears based on projected sea ice loss over the next 3 generations (ca. 33-45 years). It is an issue of fasting duration that causes polar bear population declines and this is well understood in the published literature. Dr. Crockford is following the standard climate change denier approach of picking on a specific detail and then contriving an unsubstantiated fictional account on that point. Loss of sea ice in summer is, by and large, irrelevant. It’s the duration of the ice-free period that matters. If not, polar bears in Hudson Bay would have disappeared hundreds or thousands of years ago but they didn’t because they used to be able to obtain sufficient fat stores while hunting seals on the sea ice in spring. The situation is changing but the best estimate is that we’ll have significant declines in the Western Hudson Bay population (beyond the current ca. 30% decline) by mid-century. By repeating it often enough, it appears that deniers or the uninformed think there’s some merit to the issue Dr. Crockford has raised.

But it shows nothing of the sort; it is based on a complete misunderstanding of the space-time variability of the atmosphere. The article commits two common, but fundamental errors that totally invalidate its claims. The first two charts are both of spatially global scale (the northern hemisphere), they illustrate the time scale error. They show northern hemisphere temperatures with millennial scale fluctuations (changes) of the order of 1°C; the so-called “medieval warming event”. Irrespective of whether these reconstructions are accurate (the global—not European—extent of the warming is the question under debate), the change occurred over time scales much longer than the 1°C warming that occurred over the last century. In the pre-industrial period, typical century long, global scale temperature fluctuations were about 0.2°C (i.e. typical century to century changes, see figure below); therefore if the temperature fluctuations followed the usual “bell-curve”, then a 1°C change in a century would have a probability of about one in 3 million of occurring naturally, the giant natural fluctuation hypothesis could easily be rejected. However, it was found that the bell curve under estimates the extreme 3% of the temperature fluctuations: extreme “black swan” events occur much more frequently than expected, yet, even when these rare extremes are taken into account, the probability of a 1°C change in a century is still less than 0.1%, it can easily be rejected1. The other fundamental error is also a scale error, but now in space rather than in time. This error is well exemplified in the fourth graph which shows data indirectly reflecting temperatures in France. Yet France is only about 0.1% of the global surface area, so that large natural fluctuations are common but are not of global significance. A common “skeptic” talking point is the fact that between 1662 and 1762, the temperature in central England increased by nearly 1 °C, i.e., about the same as the global temperature over the last century. Unfortunately for the “skeptics”, central England (greater London) is about 0.01% of the earth’s surface area so that it is not surprising that over the same period, the Northern Hemisphere temperature only increased by 0.2 °C (equal to the typical centennial change!). Finally, the third graph from China combines the two errors: the times scales are way too long and the spatial scales are way too small; it is doubly irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic global warming.

"“But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.”","Enhanced stratification of the water column is indeed one mechanism that can explain the decrease in subsurface oxygen, notably in the tropics[1]. As the upper-layer of the ocean warms faster than the deeper layers, the temperature stratification increases, with the already-warm upper layer getting warmer. This enhanced thermal stratification acts as a barrier to vertical mixing, since warmer water is less dense (like when a low density fluid (e.g. oil) tops a high density fluid (e.g. water)). This stratification can prevent oxygen coming from the surface from reaching deeper layers where it gets depleted by biological activity (respiration).

Delivery of this water is altered by the direction and strength of winds over the Amundsen Sea, a subset of the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. If winds blow from west to east across the Amundsen Sea, they promote upwelling of this deep water under ice shelves, promoting melt and hence increasing ice loss*.

Further, the projections do not take into account that increased heat-related hazards are only one factor that influences future risks. The other factors are the extent of exposure, the vulnerability of the exposed population, and the capacity of individuals and communities to prepare for and manage heatwaves. There is growing literature that sensitivity to heatwaves has declined over recent decades, presumably because of some degree of acclimatization to ever higher temperatures, increasing access to air conditioning and cooling centers, better understanding and communication of the risks of high ambient temperatures, and changing infrastructure to reduce urban heat islands.  Recent projections using different approaches that take these changes into account show that taking these factors into account decreases the magnitude of risks.

“The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years.”,"This is not per se completely incorrect, but the author does not tell us the whole story. The author refers to the growing of the ice sheet volume through snowfall throughout winter. The snow accumulated on Greenland in past winter (September-April) has indeed been remarkably high: However, this does not imply that the volume of the ice sheet is increasing, because (1) the ice sheet also loses ice through discharging icebergs; it is the difference between snowfall-driven growth and solid ice discharge that determines if the ice sheet gains or loses volume, and (2) the snow that accumulated during the winter will (at least partly) melt over the summer. That’s why we analyse changes to the ice sheet volume/mass on (at least) annual time scales. Only after the summer we will know how much of the accumulated snow has (not) been melted. uring the past years, the amount of melting has been record-high, and much of snow that accumulated over the winter melted and ran off into the ocean. Concurrently, ice discharge continued, so the Greenland ice sheet LOST considerable volume. We will know in September how much the ice sheet has changed volume this year. Two additional remarks: (a) The word “faster” should not have been used here. We are not talking about the rate of speed, but rather about the total change in volume. Also, it is easier to talk about “mass changes” than “volume changes” since the former is not sensitive to the density of the medium we are talking about (snow has a lower density than ice!). (b) The enhanced snowfall, ironically, is most probably also a signal of the strongly warming Arctic: as the atmosphere warms, it contains more moisture, and generates more precipitation. Also, record-low fall and winter sea ice extent led to large streaks of open water that might have contributed to additional moisture loading of the air.",train,cherry picking

"“In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.”","Most work on studying the dynamics of greenhouse gas balance in degrading permafrost systems, both as based on field measurements and as represented in ecosystem models for making climate feedback projections, seems to point to methane release being a relatively minor pathway for permafrost carbon to be released to the atmosphere, at least for terrestrial permafrost sources (which comprise most of the carbon mentioned here). It is true that terrestrial permafrost systems emit methane, but most of that methane is from recently photosynthesized carbon rather than older permafrost sources, and most of the carbon released from the older permafrost sources is released as either carbon dioxide or dissolved organic carbon rather than methane. So, while uncertainty on this issue remains high, and permafrost thaw is a potentially strong feedback process, this feedback seems likely to be dominated by carbon dioxide rather than methane. A specifically misleading thing about these numbers, which are a metric called “global warming potential”, is that their units are based on the mass of the gas. Since the question here is whether a given atom of carbon will be emitted to the atmosphere contained within either a molecule of carbon dioxide or a molecule of methane, you have to take into account the fact that the molecule of carbon dioxide is much heavier, because of the two oxygen atoms it picks up in the transformation to that gas, versus the four hydrogen atoms it would acquire in becoming methane. What this means in practice is that you have to divide the global warming potential by the ratio of the weight of the molecules, which is 44/16 or 2.75. So strictly speaking, the 34 and 86 ought to read 12 and 31.

In fact, from the scientific literature it seems the phenomenon is more likely to take place during the period 2040-2060. Of course, a very low probability does not necessarily mean a zero probability, and IPCC’s report could possibly underestimate the odds for disappearance within the next few years.

So in addition to all the devastating and obvious effects sea-level rise will produce on the planet, such as flooding and erosion, sea-level rise also has the more subtle, but nonetheless mind-boggling ability to alter the way the Earth rotates on its axis.

"“The list of variables that shape climate […] would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.”","The basic argument in the remainder of the article is one of “complexity” and the notion that climatologists cannot perfectly understand thousands of variables, and hence the behavior of the system under investigation. Jacoby is not completely wrong—climate is extremely complex, and poses no shortage of interesting research questions. However, it is sometimes difficult for non-specialists to appreciate the emergent simplicity that can arise in an incredibly complex system. After all, how do we know summer will be warmer than winter, that the top of Mt. Everest is colder than the base, or that Arizona is expected to be on average drier than Florida, or that the equator ought to be hotter than New York, or that the climate will cool following a large volcanic eruption? These statements are not just based on prior observations, but in fact can be predicted by applying fundamental equations to a rotating planet. Part of the beauty in studying atmospheric science is in gaining an appreciation for where complexity is counterbalanced by an almost eerie predictability, much like how the outcome of a single spin in roulette is hopelessly unpredictable (and certainly influenced by every slight detail at the time the dealer releases the ball), but casinos have no problem with such complexity because the statistical behavior of the roulette wheel is well-posed. Similarly, the statistical behavior of the atmosphere, while unsolved, is not actually that complex. The appeal to complexity is a compelling one. Nonetheless, progress has been made in many complex sciences (astrophysics, geology) in which the system under investigation cannot be experimentally isolated, and yet where so much is known. However, it turns out to be incredibly simple to rule out El Niño, volcanic eruptions, soil quality, sunspot cycles, plate tectonics, etc. to the trend in global temperatures since 1950. Just as geologists can inform you of the glacial history of a region, sometimes with little more than a trained eye, CO2 leaves behind “fingerprints” in the atmospheric warming that other “forcing agents” do not. Another perhaps surprising component is that this result is not extremely sensitive to unknown variables. Suppose, for example, that the Andes Mountains were abruptly flattened. This would almost certainly affect important aspects of the global and regional climate, but many of the critical phenomena of the climate system (e.g. that the equator is wet where air rises, that storm tracks develop in the mid-latitudes, the presence of a jet stream, etc.) would still remain. Furthermore, adding CO2 to a “flat-Andes hypothetical Earth” would still result in warming. It’s physics, and it’s unavoidable. It is true that the exact magnitude of future warming, even if we knew future carbon emissions perfectly, is still not known to within even 10%. However, that uncertainty range does not overlap with “very little warming” or “make the planet uninhabitable warming.” In any case, if one’s argument is based on how complex the system is, surely perturbing that complex system is not something they ought to advocate for!",train,false authority
“Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries,"The Guillet et al paper primarily uses wine grapes to look at the impact of the 1257 Samalas eruption (volcanic aerosols cool the climate, delaying grape maturation and harvest).

Contrary to the claim quoted above, our own work suggest that warming has significantly advanced wine grape harvests over western Europe1.

"“The Lancet researchers found that about 0.5%—half a percent—of all deaths are associated with heat, not only from acute problems like heat stroke, but also increased mortality from cardiac events and dehydration. But more than 7% of deaths are related to cold—counting hypothermia, as well as increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack that results when the body restricts blood flow in response to frigid temperatures.”","I do not want to question the quality of this particular study, but it’s worth looking at how they get such numbers. First, this is a statistical study where they look at data on numbers of deaths and temperatures in various locations: of course, nothing says if, or how, these deaths are really related to temperature (heat or cold). This is an empirical study. Lomborg’s comments suggest that the authors of this study are counting deaths explicitly caused by heat or cold, but this is not the case. Second, they basically fit a temperature-death risk response curve to this data. They then see for what temperature the mortality risk is lowest – and then they aggregate all the deaths below (for cold-related deaths) and above (for heat-related ones) that temperature. Because the temperature of minimum mortality is often high (around 20-25C, or lower 70’s F), for cold-related deaths this leads to integrating the response function (even with low death risks) over much of the temperature distribution. See plots below. The authors indicate as much: “This difference was mainly caused by the high minimum-mortality percentile, with most of the mean daily temperatures being lower than the optimum value.” This methodology also explains why most cold-related deaths appear due to “moderate cold”. This is worth explaining, because I am not sure dying in 15C weather (60F) in Rome or Sydney is really what people will understand when they read about “cold-related deaths”! From Gasparrini et al. figure 1: Exposure–response associations as best linear unbiased prediction (with 95% empirical CI, shaded grey) in representative cities of the 13 countries, with related temperature distributions. Solid grey lines are minimum mortality temperatures and dashed grey lines are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. RR=relative risk. The other thing that is easy to see is that the risk curve generally increases slowly towards cold temperature, but a lot more steeply past high temperatures. So even if one agrees with how this study classifies and counts “cold deaths”, the fact that they outnumber heat deaths, in absolute numbers, does not necessarily mean that increasing temperatures will reduce deaths: based on these plots, it could well be that warming will reduce cold-related deaths less than it increases heat-related ones. And indeed, this is what the studies about future projection of temperature-related deaths that they cite, and that Lomborg discusses, do find. ",train,false authority

The authors of the study admit on pages 10-11 to making the astonishing assumption that every other country in the world ignores the targets in their nationally determined contributions and make no further efforts to reduce emissions, so that much of the calculated costs to the United States economy subsequently arise from high-carbon companies relocate or lose business to competitors in other countries. The model assumes no increase in low-carbon electricity generation over the next four decades compared with the baseline scenario, so no increase in economic growth or jobs in the low-carbon sector and no substitution of low-carbon energy for high-carbon energy—emissions reductions are achieved by imposing very high carbon prices that reduce the consumption of coal and energy.

Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.”","It is accurate to say sea-level rise is approximately one foot per century. Present-day sea-level rise is a major indicator of climate change. Since the early 1990s, sea level rose at a mean rate of ~3.1 mm/yr (~1 foot over 100 years). It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise dependent on future emissions. The latest IPCC report estimates 1 to more than 3 m (up to ~10 feet) for high emission scenarios by 2300. But, those projections of sea-level rise may be limited by uncertainties surrounding the response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. For example, the report projected a likely contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) of -8 to +15 cm under the high emissions scenario by 2100, but a recent coupled ice sheet and climate dynamics model suggests that the AIS could contribute more than 1 m by 2100, and more than 10 m by 2300, under that high emissions scenario.",train,no fallacy

While it is true that clouds can act as a blanket and trap more heat, they also serve to reflect sunlight (see the prior sentence regarding the albedo effect). Which cloud effect ultimately wins out has to do with the optical thickness of the cloud (how reflective it is) and (as a rough approximation), the cloud height. As a quick rule: Higher clouds will act better as a blanket since they are both colder (and therefore radiate less energy to space) and typically optically thin.

Where the sediment is redistributed depends on a number of factors. Although sediment accretion can increase land area, it does little to change the elevation of low-lying islands, like the Marshall Islands. Therefore, people living in low-lying areas, even if there is historical land area gain, are still susceptible to inundation and damages due to storm waves, higher-than-usual tides (e.g. king tides), and sea level rise. These unconsolidated, loose sediments are also easily mobilized; therefore, localized land area gains by sediment accretion can be very dynamic on short timescales.

We hypothesize that low survival during this period resulted from (1) unfavorable ice conditions that limited access to prey during multiple seasons; and possibly, (2) low prey abundance. For reasons that are not clear, survival of adults and cubs began to improve in 2007 and abundance was comparatively stable from 2008 to 2010, with ~900 bears in 2010 (90% CI 606–1212). However, survival of subadult bears declined throughout the entire period.

However, in the short term, our findings suggest that factors other than sea ice can influence survival.” Hunter et al stated, “Deterministic models projected population growth in years with more extensive ice coverage (2001-2003) and population decline in years with less ice coverage (2004-2005). LTRE (life table response experiment) analysis showed that the reduction in lambda in years with low sea ice was due primarily to reduced adult female survival, and secondarily to reduced breeding. A stochastic model with two environmental states, good and poor sea ice conditions, projected a declining stochastic growth rate, log lambda(s), as the frequency of poor ice years increased. The observed frequency of poor ice years since 1979 would imply log lambda(s) approximate to -0.01, which agrees with available (albeit crude) observations of population size. The stochastic model was linked to a set of 10 GCMs compiled by the IPCC; the models were chosen for their ability to reproduce historical observations of sea ice and were forced with “business as usual” (A1B) greenhouse gas emissions.

It is the ability of a gas to absorb radiation, and so affect energy balance of the Earth, not its concentration, which is important. This effect on Earth’s energy balance can be quantified by the radiative forcing (RF); a positive RF means a surface warming effect and a negative RF a cooling. The figure below, from the 2013 IPCC report shows estimates of RF for a range of factors which have influenced climate from 1750-2011. As can be seen, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations have the largest RF and therefore the largest impact on climate.

Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”","This statement is absolutely ridiculous. It violates the most basic, fundamental maxim of toxicology, first articulated by the Renaissance physician Paracelsus: “The dose makes the poison.” Or, “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.” In other words, just because a substance at one concentration is harmless does not mean it is harmless at another concentration. We don’t normally think of consumption of water as harmful to humans, but at high enough doses it will kill—and has done so. A pollutant is generally defined as a substance—artificial (synthetic) or natural—that occurs in the environment at least in part because of human activity, and that has a deleterious impact on living systems. Given that basic definition, there is no way that CO2 can not be a pollutant. It is produced by a variety of human activities, but principally burning of fossil fuels. Increases in its concentration are clearly linked to global warming, which has already, and increasingly will, negatively affect living systems, including humans. The only exit from this logic is to deny that CO2 leads to warming (in contradiction to massive scientific evidence) or to deny that warming negatively impacts living systems (again in contradiction to massive evidence). The authors use a classic rhetorical ploy to confound bits of information and draw erroneous conclusions. Yes, at low concentrations CO2 is not directly harmful to humans, and in fact is required by plants. And yes, small increases in CO2 have been shown to increase plant growth. (Some of my own work has shown such; such increases also shift the chemical composition of plant tissues, and not always for the better!). Plants grown under elevated CO2 do grow faster.

That’s not reasonable. First, while people have indeed generally been moving from the North(-East) to the South over the last decades, it’s not only because of “better climate”: quoting this article by the Washington Post, “Several long-term trends dating as far back as the 1960s are behind this larger pattern. The rise of air conditioning and interstate highways have made once-sleepy (and sweltering) Southern cities more appealing. And, over the same time, the decline of industrial jobs in the Midwest and Northeast have pushed people out. Cheap housing during the boom years also drove growth in states such as Arizona and Nevada“. I think that is already much more reasonable than saying that people move South only because they know they are less likely to die from cold exposure there. Second, people may be moving there right now partly because of climate, and that may indeed be a “smart” move because, TODAY, indeed, current cold-related deaths outnumber heat-related deaths. However, even supposing that this is a significant factor in their decision process, it’s not clear that they are also thinking about future warming.

Quantitatively, however, Jacoby is off by quite a bit. In fact, water vapor constitutes ~50% of the terrestrial greenhouse effect, not 95% (see here*). Clouds (solid and liquid water that form when the vapor condenses) constitute another ~25%, but CO2 contributes to almost all of the remaining fraction (only ~5% or so from all of the other combined gases). This is because CO2 still absorbs well in spectral regions where water vapor doesn’t, and also because the upper troposphere is very dry; the ability to absorb intense surface emission and re-emit it at colder, higher layers of the atmosphere is critical for the maintenance of a planetary greenhouse effect. Secondly, the water vapor greenhouse effect is not independent of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Jacoby stresses that CO2 is only a trace component of the atmosphere, an argument that is irritatingly unoriginal and provides useless context when describing the flow of radiation through the atmosphere. As before, CO2 accounts for ~20% of Earth’s greenhouse effect. N2 and O2 account for nearly all of Earth’s atmospheric mass. However, if the atmosphere were purely N2 and O2, the planet would likely be in a snowball state due to the lack of greenhouse trapping.

the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed,"The op-ed authors reference the 2017 State of the Climate Report. I helped prepare the “Lower and Mid-Tropospheric Temperature” section and it is unclear where the authors’ statistic comes from (“seven times as much warming…”). The average CMIP5 model warming in the tropical troposphere does outpace observations (by a factor of 1.5 – 3.3, depending on dataset). This issue deserves (and has received) scrutiny.1,2,3,4,5,6 The difference in warming rates between observations and models largely arises in the early 2000s. A number of assessments have concluded that this slowdown in warming in the 2000s is in part due to natural variability (the Earth’s warming was slowed due to climate variability) and forcing (the real world experienced different solar and volcanic aerosol forcing than what was used in the models). Models do simulate natural “hiatus” periods like that experienced in the early 2000s, but, since they are random, they generally do not occur at the same times as in the real world (though some models happened to have a slowdown in warming in the early 2000s). Furthermore, forcing agents (greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar changes) are prescribed to models. Since we do not know the exact evolution of forcing agents for future projections, they are estimated. In this case, the estimated forcing was different than what occurred in the real world. When these issues are taken into account, models and observations are in agreement. Over long periods, when natural variability is a smaller issue, models and observations agree on the rate of warming.

Simply from a practical standpoint, it is beneficial to consider what is involved in sustaining the orbit of a satellite. Once put into orbit, a satellite will slowly “decay” away from its intended orbit as it is pulled nearer to Earth by gravity and other effects. Unless it has its own propulsion to correct for this, it will eventually be pulled out of orbit. This decay affects the exact time of day during which the satellite repeats measurements over one location. For example, from 1995 to 2005, the time of day that a NOAA satellite (NOAA-14) passed over the equator changed by more than 6 hours. The temperature in Quito at 12pm local time versus 6pm local time is quite different, so the satellite measurement must be corrected for this and other effects.

But we also know that the older data are of a lower quality than modern data, so we are uncertain of what part of the trends are due to the data issues and what part may be due to human influences. The scientific community has established a very strict set of rules for formally establishing whether or not a trend has been detected, and we constrain our statements within this rigid framework.

The article describes legitimate concerns that parts of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet are becoming vulnerable and hence may soon be at risk of starting an “unstoppable disintegration”, but the suggestion that this is actually already happening (and hence that major Antarctic ice loss is now avoidable) is far more speculative—as indeed the later parts of the article make clear.

“The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero.”,"he current understanding of interactions between the global carbon cycle and the climate system is that when global CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, the warming will remain approximately constant. This is very often confused by estimates of committed “warming in the pipeline” which instead of assuming that global emissions are reduced to zero, assume that concentrations (and therewith to a large degree forcing) are kept constant. Keeping CO2 concentrations constant would require continuous emissions of CO2 that perfectly counter the uptake by natural sinks. If CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, atmospheric CO2 concentrations will gradually decline. For heat-trapping emissions other than CO2, the requirement to reduce them to zero to stabilize warming depends on their residence time in the atmosphere. For gases and particles that only stay in the atmosphere for shorter time periods (days to a decade) achieving constant emissions would also achieve approximately stabilized warming.",train,vagueness

For example, IPCC AR5 WGI (Chapter 13 on sea level change) use it this way: “Future climate forcing could trigger such an unstable collapse, which may then continue independently of climate. This potential collapse might unfold over centuries for individual bedrock troughs in West Antarctica and sectors of East Antarctica.” Without this clarification, “collapse” may be misinterpreted to mean something happening over timescales of a single decade or much shorter timescales—especially when combined with earlier language about refugees “fleeing inland” due to a “rapid disintegration”",train,vagueness
“over 20 years of almost no change in temperatures”,"Bastos There has been a slow-down in global mean surface (troposphere) temperatures, but this does not call into question the fact that the Earth-system as a whole is warming. In fact, during the so-called “hiatus”, the net radiation imbalance in the top of the atmosphere persisted (implying that warming would continue even if emissions were to stop). In fact, at the same time that warming in the troposphere stalled, ocean heat content increased, especially in deeper layers: The fact that oceans took more heat from the atmosphere helps to explain the slow-down of warming at the surface. This seems to be, at least partly, explained by natural variability in the ocean (see here). Trenberth* argued, thus, that natural variability in the climate system makes the global mean surface temperature record increase in steps, rather than in a linear way. In another study, Yan and colleagues* analysed the redistribution of heat during the “hiatus” period and concluded that: “[…] the term ‘global warming hiatus’ is a misnomer, although we will continue to use the widely used phrase to describe the slowdown or pause in the increase of GMST in the late 20th to early 21st century, with quotation marks. Alternatively, we would like to suggest to the climate community to use ‘global surface warming slowdown’ instead in the future to avoid confusion. There is no absolute consensus on the specific oceanic sink for the excess heat that led to the slowdown in rising GMST (the Southern Ocean may be worth further attention though), but there is a general agreement in this group and in the literature that rather than a ‘global warming hiatus,’ the slowdown of GMST increase in 1998–2013 was a result of the increased uptake of heat energy by the global ocean during those years.” Trenberth (2015) Has there been a hiatus?, Science Yan et al (2016) The global warming hiatus: Slowdown or redistribution?, Earth’s Future ",train,vagueness
The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.,"Just to be clear, the main claim of climate science is that the global average temperature is increasing. The increase of heat waves is one of the many consequences of this. The article confusingly uses the term “record” in two meanings. The term records can be used for the observations that were recorded by meteorologists over the last centuries. The term “records” is mostly used for the highest or lowest value ever seen. In an article about the highest and lowest temperatures, it is best to avoid using the term records for the recorded data. The article also confusingly keeps on jumping between claims about local records in daily mean temperatures and claims about the long-term global mean temperature. Local temperatures are by their nature more variable than global average temperatures, daily temperatures are by their nature more variable than long-term average temperatures, records are by their nature more random than averages. With all the extra variability in the local daily records the authors can easily cherry pick a few data points that fit their narrative. What would make their case stronger would be if they actually analysed all the data, engaged with the existing scientific literature and made their own contribution to our scientific understanding by publishing a scientific paper.

“Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today”,"This is the biggest opportunity to add more depth to the analysis of this new Antarctic ice loss result. An important point here is that the human fingerprint on this Antarctic mass loss is still hard to identify. A 2013 assessment1 showed that expert opinion is “uncertain and undecided” about whether recent ice sheet behavior simply reflects natural variability or is a response to human-caused climate change. This is essentially because our observations of ice sheet behavior are too short, 30 years at best for satellite observations of the ice sheet. This just meets the minimum definition of a “climatology” with respect to the atmosphere, and we know that the ice sheet operates on longer timescales than the atmosphere (it is a big system to move!). Although West Antarctica has been one of the fastest-warming places on the planet over the last 60 years (sparse weather records begin in 1957), as Steig et al showed in 20092 and Bromwich et al confirmed in 20133, how/whether this atmospheric warming has emerged from natural climate variability is less clear. It is also unclear how this warming trend will continue, as climate in West Antarctica is pushed around by Pacific Ocean-atmosphere variability. From ice core records we (myself and MANY others) have drilled and analyzed across this region we do not see recent anomalies exceeding variability over the last 2000 years4. From measurements of ice borehole temperatures in the same region, the ice itself directly records anomalous warmth over the last 50 years5. Antarctic weather is known to be harsh but it is also some of the most variable on the planet. The human fingerprint of atmospheric warming has emerged everywhere else on the planet as early as about 200 years ago, but we are still waiting for it to clearly emerge in Antarctica (see Figure 2 in Abram et al, 20166). As Mooney explains, how much atmospheric warming comes to Antarctica largely depends on our carbon emission choices in the near-term. In addition to all of this, the ice loss in West Antarctica is less driven by ocean warming as it is by increased delivery of relatively-warm deep ocean currents beneath ice shelves. This delivery is driven by the atmosphere; whether winds blow strong enough in the right direction to drive upwelling currents beneath Pacific-facing West Antarctic ice shelves. Decadal-scale variability of the Pacific Ocean-atmosphere system in turn affect the strength and position of these current-driving winds. Summary: it’s very complicated but the Pacific Ocean is the beast to watch for future West Antarctic ice loss, in combination with the dynamics of Pine Island, Thwaites, and a few smaller glaciers (Smith, Kohler) along the Amundsen Sea coast of West Antarctica. 1-Bamber and Aspinall (2013) An expert judgement assessment of future sea level rise from the ice sheets, Nature Climate Change 2-Steig et al (2019) Warming of the Antarctic ice-sheet surface since the 1957 International Geophysical Year, Nature 3-Bromwich et al (2013) Central West Antarctica among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, Nature Geoscience 4-Steig et al (2013) Recent climate and ice-sheet changes in West Antarctica compared with the past 2,000 years, Nature Geoscience 5-Orsi et al (2012) Little Ice Age cold interval in West Antarctica: Evidence from borehole temperature at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide, Geophysical Research Letters 6-Abram et al (2016) Early onset of industrial-era warming across the oceans and continents, Nature ",test,cherry picking

The bottom line is there’s no solid connection between climate change and the major indicators of extreme weather,"As stated in my comments above, this conclusion is not valid. It is based on incomplete reasoning.

But, it is good to remember that 1998 is a favorite starting point for those that seek to minimize the perceived threat of global warming. This preference is because 1998 is a relative maximum in global temperature (due to a large ENSO event), and thus trends that start in Jan 1998 are smaller than trends that start in other, nearby years. This means that when the change in trends between datasets is reported as a multiplicative effect, the change appears quite large.

The DeConto & Pollard study1 does not include the potential for sea level rise from thermal expansion of sea water, melting of mountain glaciers or the Greenland Ice Sheet in it’s projections, but if these are included, the total sea level rise projected for 2100 may be something like 6 feet. If this is the calculation implicit in this statement that “…six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings”, than it is perhaps a bit misleading, since DeConto & Pollard is only focused on the contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. As DeConto & Pollard say in their study: “…the rates of ice loss simulated here should not be viewed as actual predictions, but rather as possible envelopes of behaviour”. Determining the “likely” amount of sea level rise in the future is a prediction that is strongly dependent on the assumptions about how ice sheet behave and on what time scales. Based on just DeConto & Pollard’s studies, and the assumptions inherent in their model, one can conclude that it is likely that sea level will rise by more than 11 feet, just from Antarctic melting, over the next several centuries, if humans do not significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (see Figure 5 and S7 of DeConto & Pollard 2016). What the glaciological community as a whole considers “likely” depends on which processes we think are likely to be important contributors of ice sheet collapse, which is a matter that is actively under debate.

For every one degree increase in sea surface temperature, the saturation vapor pressure increases by about 7% based on the “Clausius-Clapeyron” equation.

Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”","This is flawed reasoning as it is not a sensible analogy for how the greenhouse effect works. The science is more complex: Namely, radiation from the surface at a warmer temperature is absorbed in the layers above which are at a colder temperature; the colder layers emit less radiation so that there is a net loss of radiative energy escaping to space from the atmosphere-surface system as a whole, but coming about due to the “exchange” as formulated. This is true in absorption bands that are transparent and not opaque—i.e., in bands that are not saturated. In bands that are opaque, the radiation emanating from the layer to space represents a “cooling-to-space” and this too represents a “trapping”. In this regard, the lapse-rate and decrease of temperature with height (in the troposphere) are important. The more CO2 that is added to the atmosphere, the more heat that is “trapped” in the climate system, although it is not 1:1 and is instead a logarithmic relationship.

Additional moisture is also evaporated from the open ocean, which not only traps additional heat as a greenhouse gas, but also tends to form more clouds that also trap heat. An unusually wavy jet-stream pattern has also transported extra heat and moisture from lower-latitude regions into the Arctic, adding to the warmth.

Let’s try and disentangle things. It is correct that Virginia Key as well as other locations on the US Atlantic coast have experienced a surge of rapid sea-level rise during the past ten years or so. However, this is a very short period in terms of sea-level variations. The longer-term rise in this region (when corrected for local land subsidence) is actually in line with the global average sea-level rise, both for the past hundred years (~1.8mm per year) or measured since the early 1990s (~3 mm per year). The recent rapid rise is thus likely a short-term natural variation (a possibility mentioned later in the article) and may well be followed by a period of very little rise. In the longer run I would expect that sea-level near Miami would continue to increase roughly in line with the global mean sea-level rise, as is indeed discussed later in the article where the future projections with their uncertainties are covered well. It is correct that local sea-level rise can differ from global sea-level rise due to “a variety of factors”, including a weakening of the Gulf Stream. For the relevant period of rapid rise, the last ten years or so, such a weakening has been documented, e.g. in the direct measurements in the RAPID section at 26 °N. So the rapid sea-level rise and the weakening of the larger Gulf Stream System coincide, and have indeed been linked.* Like with sea level, over the short time scale of the past decade this is likely to be dominated by natural variability, although there are also indications of a longer-term, probably human-caused, downward trend. Greenland melting has not caused this, but likely contributed to it. To what extent the Gulf Stream weakening explains the recent rapid sea-level rise in Miami, and to what extent other factors—like changes in the predominant winds—are responsible remains an open research question.

Without these ecosystems, atmospheric CO2 concentration would have risen even more as a consequence of fossil fuel burning; the CO2 concentration in the air would already be around 550 ppm (instead of the current ~400 ppm). Hence, it is absolutely misleading to compare amounts of CO2 cycling through the ecosystems with human CO2 emissions in this context.

“But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.”,"The statement is fairly accurate but leaves the inference of causes up to the reader. A recent paper by Santer et al. (2016)* investigated this issue in considerable detail. For middle tropospheric temperatures the paper found that, on average, models showed 1.71 times more warming than the mean of the most recent version of the satellite data for the 1979-2015 period. This is for near global mean temperatures. For the lower troposphere, the models show about 2 times more warming than the satellites. Note that the Remote Sensing Systems lower tropospheric dataset has not yet been upgraded to the latest version, which is likely to show more warming. The article does not discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, but given the tone of the rest of the article, the reader is expected to use the trend differences as evidence that long-term projections by climate models are suspect. These ratios do not provide such evidence. At least part of the discrepancy is known to be caused by errors in the forcings used to drive the CMIP-5 climate models. After the year 2000, the CMIP-5 models were driven by forecast values for important parameters such as volcanic aerosols, solar output, and stratospheric ozone. The forecasts turned out to be slightly inaccurate, causing the models to predict more warming than they would have if the correct forcings had been used. (Of course, these correct forcings were in the future and thus unknowable at the time the model computations were performed). Other possible causes include natural variability in the real world (which might produce a period of reduced warming) and errors in the model physics. Only errors in the model physics would cause long-term global warming to be overestimated, and there is no significant evidence that supports large errors in the model physics. Over a much longer time period, 1880-present, the warming at the surface agrees well with that expected by the CMIP-5 models. The longer time period is important because the effects of random fluctuations due to natural variability tend to average away as the time period considered gets longer. Santer et al.

Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”","This depends on the definition of “pollutant”. To the extent that CO2-induced global warming endangers human welfare and health, CO2 fits the Clean Air Act’s broad definition of “air pollutants”—that’s the reasoning behind the Supreme Court’s decision to let the EPA regulate CO2 emissions. Not that this is relevant to the definition of CO2 as a pollutant (which relies on it causing climate change), but the alleged total non-toxicity is not entirely true: there is some research* showing impairments in cognitive function test scores in people exposed to CO2 concentrations in the 950-1,000 ppm range, and even significantly worse performance when CO2 rose to 1500 and 2,500 ppm. Current atmospheric CO2 is around 400 ppm—possibly going up at least a few more hundred ppm this century without emission cuts—but concentrations greater than ~1000 ppm are often found in poorly ventilated rooms and buildings.

“Not everyone is convinced that the evidence is in that climate change is responsible for extreme swings between drought and deluge.”,"There is a considerable and growing body of scientific evidence (see above references) demonstrating that California will likely experience increasingly large swings between extreme wet and extreme dry conditions. The evidence that climate change has already caused such an increase is somewhat less strong—mainly because there are relatively few extreme events in the historical record from which to draw such conclusions. Therefore, this statement is imprecise, and may be misleading if it is intended to convey that scientists substantially disagree regarding the likely future increase in California precipitation extremes. Whether such an increase is yet detectable in the historical record is indeed uncertain; there is much greater certainty regarding the likely direction of future change.",test,vagueness
“a constant swarm of out-of-control typhoons and tornadoes and floods and droughts”,"Not to nitpick—we don’t really know what a +6 °C world would look like in detail—but the connection between tornadoes and warming is unclear, at least in the observable record. Daniel Swain, Researcher, UCLA, and Research Fellow, National Center for Atmospheric Research: While there is still some uncertainty regarding the response of tropical cyclones (i.e. typhoons and hurricanes) to global warming, there is now evidence that frequency in many ocean basins may actually decrease, but maximum intensity will likely increase. There is indeed evidence that the frequency and intensity of floods/droughts is increasing over much of the globe*, and will continue to do so as the climate warms. This is not necessarily true universally–there will still be quite a bit of spatial and temporal diversity in the response of precipitation extremes to global warming, even in a six-degree-warmer world. But in general, it’s true that there will be dramatically more flood and drought events on a global basis with multiple degrees of warming.

"“and we will need to have invented technologies to extract, annually, twice as much carbon from the atmosphere as the entire planet’s plants now do”","Its unclear in this statement, about the relative amount of negative emissions needed versus the amount of carbon extracted by plants, whether the author means the total amount of photosynthesis by plants (which would be a false statement) or the total difference between photosynthesis, respiration, and disturbance (which would be a true statement). Plants photosynthesize about 120 petagrams of carbon per year, whereas the net land sink is more like 2-3 petagrams of carbon per year. It is the latter number that is comparable in magnitude to the negative emissions technologies required. ",test,vagueness
"“Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century. That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago. But those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them. ‘We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,’said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ‘There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica.’”"," The “recent computer forecasts” referenced here likely refer to the numerical model developed by Rob DeConto1. Different from other ice-sheet models it includes the so-called “Marine Ice Cliff Instability”, which at present is not widely accepted in the ice-sheet modeling community. Including this instability will cause increased rates for resultant sea-level rise projections. On the other hand, DeConto’s model includes simplifications related to how ice sheet slides over the sediment at the base. This ice-sliding parameterization will generally increase ice-sheet stability and cause smaller projections of sea-level rise, as demonstrated in the Nature paper by C. Ritz et al. in 20152. There is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the physical and hydrological processes involved in ice-sheet modeling. Ideally, we prepare for the upper bounds regarding projected rates in sea-level rise, since the scientific community is still far from providing high-confidence estimates. DeConto and Pollard (2016) Contribution of Antarctica to past and future sea-level rise, Nature Ritz et al (2015) Potential sea-level rise from Antarctic ice-sheet instability constrained by observations, Nature Margot Saher, Lecturer, Bangor University, Wales, UK: This is based on a combination of observations and modelling1. Observations show us several glaciers are in decline2 and ice shelves, which serve as a buttress for the glaciers, are thinning due to warmer sea water. This process is seen to be accelerating3. Where ice shelves (like Larsen B) have already vanished, glaciers in the hinterland have indeed sped up4. Numerical models predict that the changes underway now are likely to lead to a full-scale collapse of the west Antarctic Ice Sheet. 1- Joughin et al (2014) Marine Ice Sheet Collapse Potentially Under Way for the Thwaites Glacier Basin, West Antarctica, Science 2- Rignot et al (2011) Acceleration of the contribution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets to sea level rise, Geophysical Research Letters 3- Paolo et al (2015) Volume loss from Antarctic ice shelves is accelerating, Science 4- Scambos et al (2004) Glacier acceleration and thinning after ice shelf collapse in the Larsen B embayment, Antarctica, Geophysical Research Letters ",test,vagueness
