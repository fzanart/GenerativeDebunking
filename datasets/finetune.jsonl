Recording stations are sparse, even nonexistent in vital global locations, most particularly throughout the Southern Hemisphere and in remote polar regions. After 1970 the number of reporting stations dropped suddenly and drastically. (Stations at airports have seemed to be unaffected, and may even have increased in number.) And as John noted, urban heat islands have developed over time, not to mention problems resulting from faulty placements of temperature recording instruments which have to be \"corrected\" by applying subjective \"homogenizing' (tuning) procedures. ->", "completion": " {'TITLE': 'How scientists find climate signals in thermometer measurements', 'FACT': 'Temperature measurements in the city versus rural areas have differences too minor to account for the rise in temperature shown by climate change. ', 'MYTH': 'Temperature data is affected by non-climate factors and measuring limitations. Therefore the temperature record is unreliable.', 'FALLACY': 'This myth is based on the logical fallacy of slothful induction, as it ignores comparisons to temperature measurements made outside of cities, with the difference being too minor to influence the overall climate change trend.'}"}
{"prompt": "Pat Michaels is in San Francisco this week attending the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) and presenting a poster detailing the widening mismatch between observations of the earths temperature and climate model projections of its behavior. Since most global warming concern (including that behind regulatory action) stems from the projections of climate models as to how the earth's temperature will evolve as we emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere (as a result of burning fossil fuels to produce energy), it is important to keep a tab on how the model projections are faring when compared with reality. That they are faring not very well should be more widely known Pat will spread the word while there. ->", "completion": " {'TITLE': 'Climate models provide valuable insights', 'FACT': 'Climate models can never be 100% accurate but they offer valuable insights into how our climate works.', 'MYTH': 'Climate model predictions don't match observations. Therefore climate models are unreliable.', 'FALLACY': 'This myth is based on the logical fallacy of impossible expectation, as climate models projections are averaged over time to reflect long-term externally-forced changes, smoothing out short-term variability like ocean cycles or volcanic eruptions. It's impossible to expect that the two will exactly match.'}"}
{"prompt": "It is difficult to explain the whole climate-change panic except in religious terms. There has arisen among some in the environmental community what can only be understood as a cult of Earth worship - it is against energy, against mining, against land use, against industry, and against industrial society. Climate change is a useful tool in that fear of catastrophe can be used to compel economically destructive actions that would otherwise be unacceptable. It is not just carbon-based energy they hate, but nuclear as well, which indicates the true nature of the faith. Alternatives such as wind and solar can never be effective, but they are useful as Judas goats. ->", "completion": " {'TITLE': 'Climate science is based on evidence, not faith', 'FACT': 'Climate science is evidence-based whilst religion is faith-based.', 'MYTH': 'The climate change movement have some trait in common with religion. Therefore the climate change movement is a religion and unscientific.', 'FALLACY': 'This myth is based on the logical fallacy of false equivalence, as climate science is evidence-based while religion is faith-based.'}"}
{"prompt": "With these words last December 14, the New Zealand Herald editorial writer signalled his slant. Its a bias towards the official line on global warming. The Herald joins the chorus of activists baying for Western compensation for the third world to answer the allegations of injury by climate. ->", "completion": " {'TITLE': 'Media coverage of climate change', 'FACT': 'Reporting on evidence-based climate science is not biased, but a reflection of best scientific understanding at the time.', 'MYTH': 'Media portrayal of climate change supports the mainstream view. Therefore the media are biased and cannot be trusted.', 'FALLACY': 'This myth is based on the logical fallacy of ad hominem, as it personally attacks the media rather than addresses their arguments.'}"}
{"prompt": "The US government spends $2.5 billion per year on research that focuses on carbon dioxide, ignores powerful natural forces that have always driven climate change, and generates numerous reports and press releases warning of record high temperatures, melting icecaps, rising seas, stronger storms, more droughts and other \"unprecedented\" crises. The claims are erroneous and deceitful. ->", "completion": " {'TITLE': 'Politics and climate change', 'FACT': 'Supporting evidence-based scientific research into climate change is not biased or partisan.', 'MYTH': 'Governments and politicians support the mainstream view on climate change.

{"prompt": "Radical environmentalists even tried to blame global warming for the devastating 2011 tsunami - a tragedy caused by a 9.0 offshore earthquake. To suggest that auto emissions cause tectonic plates to shift sounds like quite a stretch, but global warming zeal apparently has no limits. ->", "completion": " {'TITLE': 'The importance of environmental movements', 'FACT': 'Environmentalists play an important role in raising awareness and driving climate action. While they may occasionally make scientific errors, their advocacy and mobilization efforts contribute to public engagement, policy discussions, and protection of natural resources.', 'MYTH': 'Environmentalists get science wrong as they're not committed to science.

{"prompt": "There is little doubt that some players in the climate game not a lot, but enough to have severely damaged the reputation of climate scientists in general have stepped across the boundary into postmodern science. The Climategate scandal of 2009, wherein thousands of emails were leaked from the Climate Research Unit of the University of East Anglia in England, showed that certain senior members of the research community were, and presumably still are, quite capable of deliberately selecting data in order to overstate the evidence for dangerous climate change. The emails showed as well that these senior members were quite happy to discuss ways and means of controlling the research journals so as to deny publication of any material that goes against the orthodox dogma. The ways and means included the sacking of recalcitrant editors. ->", "completion": " {'TITLE': 'The scientific method makes climate science more robust', 'FACT': 'While it is impossible for all scientists to be unbiased, the findings of climate science have been supported by many different scientists around the world and many independent methodologies.', 'MYTH': 'Scientists act in biased or unethical ways.

{"prompt": "Multiple large corporations are now working with Obama and Democrats to pass the infamous 'cap & trade' legislation, which will result in the the consumer and small businesses absorbing the trillions of dollars of direct/indirect costs it will generate. These big corporations are working behind the scenes for their own benefit, without regard to their customers or suppliers.

{"prompt": "Professor Mann is currently under investigation by Penn State University because of activities related to a closed circle of climate scientists who appear to have been engaged in agenda-driven science. Emails and documents mysteriously released from the previously-prestigious Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom revealed discussions of manipulation and destruction of research data, as well as efforts to interfere with the peer review process to stifle opposing views. The motivation underlying these efforts appears to be a coordinated strategy to support the belief that mankind's activities are causing global warming. ->", "completion": " {'TITLE': 'Climate science is based on the scientific process', 'FACT': 'The scientific consensus on climate change was not formed through collusion or a hidden agenda but rather through rigorous scrutiny of data, peer review, and the open exchange of ideas within the scientific community.
