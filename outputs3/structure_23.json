                "explanation": "The premise presents a false choice between implementing climate policy and keeping energy costs low, when in reality there are ways to address climate change without significantly increasing energy costs. Additionally, the premise assumes that the only cost of climate change is the cost of implementing policy, ignoring the potentially catastrophic costs of inaction."

                "explanation": "The premise oversimplifies the relationship between climate policy and energy costs, ignoring the complexity of the issue and the potential for innovative solutions that could mitigate the impact of policy on energy costs."

        "yes/no": "YES",
        "explanation": "The premise is a non sequitur, as it doesn't logically follow that increased energy costs will have harmful effects. While it is possible that increased energy costs could have harmful effects, it is not necessarily true in all cases."

    "A": "Climate policy increases energy costs and increased energy costs will have harmful effects. Therefore climate policy is harmful.",
    "valid": "FALSE",
    "reason": "This argument is logically invalid. The premises only establish that climate policy will increase energy costs and that increased energy costs will have harmful effects. However, it does not necessarily follow that climate policy is harmful overall, as there may be benefits to implementing such policies that outweigh the negative effects of increased energy costs. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",

        "technique": "False Dilemma",
        "yes/no": "YES",
        "explanation": "The premise presents a false dilemma by assuming that there are only two options: either implement climate policy or avoid increased energy costs. This ignores the possibility that climate policy could have benefits that outweigh the costs, or that there may be other ways to address climate change that do not involve increased energy costs."
