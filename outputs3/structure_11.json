    "valid": "FALSE",
    "reason": "This argument is logically invalid. Just because ocean cycles influence global temperature, it does not necessarily mean that they are the sole cause of global warming. Other factors such as human activities and greenhouse gas emissions could also be contributing to global warming.",

        "premise": "There are no other factors that influence global temperature besides ocean cycles.",
        "technique": "Single Cause",
        "yes/no": "YES",
        "explanation": "The premise is an example of the Single Cause fallacy, which assumes that there is only one cause for a particular phenomenon when there may be multiple causes. In this case, the premise suggests that ocean cycles are the only factor that influences global temperature, which is not supported by scientific evidence. There are many factors that influence global temperature, including greenhouse gas concentrations, solar radiation, volcanic activity, and human activities such as deforestation and burning fossil fuels."
