        "technique": "Logical Fallacies",
        "yes/no": "YES",
        "explanation": "The premise is a non sequitur because the fact that proxy data is affected by non-climate factors does not necessarily mean that it is not a valid source of information about past climate conditions. It is possible to account for non-climate factors and still use proxy data to reconstruct past climate conditions."
    },
    "P2": "Proxy data is affected by measuring limitations.",
    "C": "Therefore, climate proxies are unreliable.",
    "A": "Proxy data is affected by non-climate factors and measuring limitations. Therefore climate proxies are unreliable.",
    "valid": "TRUE",
    "reason": "The argument is logically valid because if both premises are true, then it follows logically that the conclusion is also true. If proxy data is affected by non-climate factors and measuring limitations, then it is reasonable to conclude that climate proxies are unreliable."
