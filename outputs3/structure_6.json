        "technique": "Logical Fallacies",
        "yes/no": "YES",
        "explanation": "This statement is an example of the logical fallacy known as 'cherry picking'. It selectively focuses on a short period of time to support a particular argument while ignoring the larger trend of warming over a longer period of time."

    "C": "Therefore, global warming is not happening.",
    "A": "There's been no warming over a short period. Therefore global warming is not happening.",
    "valid": "FALSE",
    "reason": "This argument is logically invalid. The conclusion does not follow from the premise. Just because there has been no warming over a short period of time does not mean that global warming is not happening. Global warming refers to a long-term trend of increasing temperatures, not short-term fluctuations.",

        "premise": "Global warming can only be determined by analyzing long-term trends, not short-term fluctuations.",
        "technique": "Logical Fallacies",
        "yes/no": "YES",
        "explanation": "The premise is a valid statement. It is true that global warming can only be determined by analyzing long-term trends, not short-term fluctuations. This is because global warming refers to the long-term increase in the Earth's average surface temperature, and short-term fluctuations can be caused by a variety of factors that are not related to global warming. However, the premise is not a logical fallacy."
