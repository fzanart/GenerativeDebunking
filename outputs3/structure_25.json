        "premise": "Climate policy limits the choices available to people and communities.",
        "technique": "False Choice",
        "yes/no": "YES",
        "explanation": "The statement presents a false choice between climate policy and individual freedom, implying that climate policy necessarily limits individual choice. However, this is a false dichotomy, as climate policy can be designed to promote sustainable development and protect the environment while also respecting individual rights and freedoms. Therefore, the statement is an example of the false choice fallacy."
    },
    "C": "Therefore, climate policy reduces people's freedom.",
    "A": "Climate policy limits the choices available to people and communities. Therefore climate policy reduces people's freedom.",
    "valid": "TRUE",
    "reason": "The argument is logically valid because if it is true that climate policy limits people's choices then it follows that it reduces their freedom."
