    "valid": "FALSE",
    "reason": "This argument is logically invalid. The occurrence of cold weather events does not disprove the existence of global warming. Global warming refers to the long-term trend of increasing global temperatures, not just short-term weather events. In fact, extreme weather events such as cold snaps can actually be a result of global warming disrupting normal weather patterns.",

        "yes/no": "NO",
        "explanation": "The premise presents a false dichotomy by suggesting that either global warming is happening or cold weather events are happening. In reality, global warming can cause changes in weather patterns that can lead to both warmer and colder weather events in different regions."
