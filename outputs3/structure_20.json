    "valid": "FALSE",
    "reason": "This argument is logically invalid. The fact that polar bear populations are increasing in some regions does not necessarily mean that global warming is not harming polar bear populations. There may be other factors contributing to the increase in population, and global warming may still be affecting polar bear populations in other regions.",

        "premise": "Polar bear populations can only be harmed by global warming if they are decreasing in all regions.",
        "technique": "Single Cause",
        "yes/no": "YES",
        "explanation": "The premise assumes that the only way global warming can harm polar bear populations is if they are decreasing in all regions. This is a single cause fallacy because it ignores the fact that there may be multiple causes for polar bear population decline, including habitat loss, hunting, and pollution. Global warming may exacerbate these other factors, but it is not the only cause of population decline."
