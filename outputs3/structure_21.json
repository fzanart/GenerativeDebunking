While it is true that coral reefs may have some resilience to acidification and bleaching, it does not mean that they are not seriously impacted by climate change. Climate change can also cause other factors such as ocean warming, sea level rise, and changes in ocean currents that can have serious impacts on coral reefs. Therefore, the conclusion is not supported by the premise."
