The premise that much of the public aren't convinced about the need for climate action does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that political action on climate change is too hard.

        "explanation": "The premise is an example of a conditional statement, which is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The argument assumes that if the public is not convinced about the need for climate action, then politicians will not prioritize climate action. However, this does not necessarily follow, as there may be other factors that influence politicians' decisions. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid."
