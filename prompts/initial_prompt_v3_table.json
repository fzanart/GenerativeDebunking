"| LABEL | DEFINITION | EXAMPLE |\n|---|---|---|\n| Ambiguity | Using ambiguous language in order to lead to a misleading conclusion. | \u201cThermometer readings have uncertainty which means we don't know whether global warming is happening.\u201d |\n| Cherry Picking | Carefully selecting data that appear to confirm one position while ignoring other data that contradicts that position. | \u201cGlobal warming stopped in 1998.\u201d |\n| Fake Experts | Presenting an unqualified person or institution as a source of credible information. | \u201cA retired physicist argues against the climate consensus, claiming the current weather change is just a natural occurrence.\u201d |\n| False Analogy | Assuming that because two things are alike in some ways, they are alike in some other respect. | \u201cClimate skeptics are like Galileo who overturned the scientific consensus about geocentrism.\u201d |\n| Oversimplification | Simplifying a situation in such a way as to distort understanding, leading to erroneous conclusions. | \u201cCO2 is plant food so burning fossil fuels will be good for plants.\u201d |\n| Red Herring | Deliberately diverting attention to an irrelevant point to distract from a more important point. | \u201cCO2 is a trace gas so it's warming effect is minimal.\u201d |\n| Straw Man | Misrepresenting or exaggerating an opponent's position to make it easier to attack. | \u201cIn the 1970s, climate scientists were predicting an ice age.\u201d |"
