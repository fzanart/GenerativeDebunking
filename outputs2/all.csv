"“Recent computer forecasts suggest that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at a high level, parts of Antarctica could break up rapidly, causing the ocean to rise six feet or more by the end of this century. That is double the maximum increase that an international climate panel projected only four years ago. But those computer forecasts were described as crude even by the researchers who created them. ‘We could be decades too fast, or decades too slow,’said one of them, Robert M. DeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ‘There are still some really big question marks about the trajectory of future climate around Antarctica.’”"," The “recent computer forecasts” referenced here likely refer to the numerical model developed by Rob DeConto1. Different from other ice-sheet models it includes the so-called “Marine Ice Cliff Instability”, which at present is not widely accepted in the ice-sheet modeling community. Including this instability will cause increased rates for resultant sea-level rise projections. On the other hand, DeConto’s model includes simplifications related to how ice sheet slides over the sediment at the base. This ice-sliding parameterization will generally increase ice-sheet stability and cause smaller projections of sea-level rise, as demonstrated in the Nature paper by C. Ritz et al. in 20152. There is still a lot of uncertainty regarding the physical and hydrological processes involved in ice-sheet modeling. Ideally, we prepare for the upper bounds regarding projected rates in sea-level rise, since the scientific community is still far from providing high-confidence estimates.

“So it’s been a surprise to climate scientists that 2017 has been so remarkably warm — because the last El Niño ended a year ago.”,"The claim that this is “a surprise to climate scientists” is not correct. In December 2016, climate scientists at the UK’s Met Office Hadley Centre predicted that 2017 would be “another very warm year for global temperatures”. 2017 was forecast to be among the warmest on record, but not as warm as 2016, so what is happening is actually consistent with the prediction.",train,no fallacy,"TITLE: El Niño is not the only factor affecting global temperatures
FACT1: El Niño is a natural climate pattern that occurs every few years, characterized by warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. It can have a significant impact on global temperatures, but it is not the only factor affecting them. Other factors include greenhouse gas emissions, solar activity, and volcanic eruptions.
MYTH: El Niño is the only reason for the recent warm temperatures.
FALLACY: This statement is an oversimplification, as it implies that El Niño is the sole cause of the recent warm temperatures. In reality, while El Niño can have a significant impact on global temperatures, it is just one of many factors that contribute to climate variability. Focusing solely on El Niño ignores the role of other factors, such as human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, in driving long-term warming trends.
FACT2: Let's not overlook the role of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions in driving long-term warming trends. It is important to recognize the complexity of climate variability and the multiple factors that contribute to it."

"“climate economists see a positive externality, not a negative one, from the human influence on climate. (In technical lingo, the so-called social cost of carbon would be negative.)”","This is cherry-picking at its worst. You can always find an economist who will make enough assumptions so that he or she can give you the answer you want. In this case (references the social cost of carbon), you can get a benefit ONLY if you assume a very high discount rate (like 5% so that future generations do not matter), and you ignore equity issues, and you assume that warmer climates in the crop-intensive areas will not include an increase in the intensity and/or frequency of intense weather (drought, floods, etc….), and you do not recognize that warmer temperatures mean more pests and more weeds. see the Summary for Policymakers of the Report of Working Group II to the fourth assessment of the IPCC",train,cherry picking,"TITLE: Climate Change Can Have Positive Externalities
FACT1: Climate change can have positive externalities, which are benefits that are not reflected in market prices. For example, a warmer climate may increase agricultural productivity in some regions, leading to lower food prices and increased food security. Additionally, some economists argue that the social cost of carbon, which measures the economic damage caused by carbon emissions, could be negative, meaning that the benefits of carbon emissions may outweigh the costs in some cases.

MYTH: Climate Change Only Has Negative Consequences
FALLACY: The myth that climate change only has negative consequences is a false dichotomy, which presents only two options when there may be more. Climate change can have both positive and negative consequences, and it is important to consider both when evaluating the costs and benefits of different policies.

FACT2: It is important to consider both the positive and negative externalities of climate change when evaluating policies to address it. By doing so, we can make more informed decisions that take into account the full range of impacts on society and the environment. Let's not oversimplify the issue and instead strive for a comprehensive understanding of the complex challenges posed by climate change."

MYTH: Halving the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere would cause all life to die.
FALLACY: This myth is an example of a false dilemma fallacy, which presents only two extreme options and ignores the possibility of a middle ground. In reality, reducing carbon dioxide levels to a certain extent could have negative consequences for some species, but it would not necessarily cause all life to die.

FALLACY: This argument is an example of a false equivalence fallacy, which assumes that because Singapore is a desirable city to live in despite its high sea levels, rising sea levels caused by climate change are not a concern. This ignores the fact that Singapore has implemented extensive measures to mitigate the effects of rising sea levels, and that the situation could be much worse without these measures.
FACT2: Rising sea levels caused by climate change are a serious concern for low-lying cities like Singapore.

"“In the geological past, Earth’s atmosphere had hundreds of times the CO2 content of the modern atmosphere yet there were no carbon dioxide-driven catastrophes. The past shows that climate change is normal, that warmer times and more atmospheric carbon dioxide have driven biodiversity and that cold times kill.”","There are many problems with this statement, starting with an entire lack of accuracy. It reads like a series of generic statements that can easily be taken out of context and are entirely irrelevant to the problem at hand.

FACT1: Earth's climate has changed naturally in the past, with fluctuations in temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels. These changes have driven biodiversity and have been a normal part of Earth's history.
MYTH: The belief that because Earth's atmosphere had higher CO2 levels in the past without catastrophic consequences, current increases in CO2 levels are not a cause for concern.
FALLACY: This argument is a false equivalence fallacy, as it assumes that just because Earth's climate has changed naturally in the past, current changes are also natural and not influenced by human activity. It also ignores the fact that the rate of CO2 increase is much faster than in the past, and that the current levels are higher than they have been in millions of years.
FACT2: Let's not use the past as an excuse to ignore the current scientific consensus on climate change.

"“It’s far too early to tell if what we are seeing in the Arctic, and now the Antarctic, is a sharp shift towards warmer poles with less ice. Scientists are quick to point out that weather in these regions can change quickly, but this is another expected result of climate change.”","Certainly the loss of sea ice is largely a result of warming from increased atmospheric concentrations of CO2. So it’s not surprising to see the changes in the Arctic. Climate models also predict that Antarctic sea ice will decline eventually, especially once the ozone hole recovers. There is some evidence* that the ozone hole has led to stronger circumpolar winds that spread the Antarctic sea ice cover out from the continent and since there is no land to bound the sea ice (like in the Arctic) it can expand towards the equator until it reaches warmer ocean temperatures.

"“The Lancet researchers found that about 0.5%—half a percent—of all deaths are associated with heat, not only from acute problems like heat stroke, but also increased mortality from cardiac events and dehydration. But more than 7% of deaths are related to cold—counting hypothermia, as well as increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack that results when the body restricts blood flow in response to frigid temperatures.”","I do not want to question the quality of this particular study, but it’s worth looking at how they get such numbers. First, this is a statistical study where they look at data on numbers of deaths and temperatures in various locations: of course, nothing says if, or how, these deaths are really related to temperature (heat or cold). This is an empirical study. Lomborg’s comments suggest that the authors of this study are counting deaths explicitly caused by heat or cold, but this is not the case. Second, they basically fit a temperature-death risk response curve to this data. They then see for what temperature the mortality risk is lowest – and then they aggregate all the deaths below (for cold-related deaths) and above (for heat-related ones) that temperature. Because the temperature of minimum mortality is often high (around 20-25C, or lower 70’s F), for cold-related deaths this leads to integrating the response function (even with low death risks) over much of the temperature distribution. See plots below. The authors indicate as much: “This difference was mainly caused by the high minimum-mortality percentile, with most of the mean daily temperatures being lower than the optimum value.” This methodology also explains why most cold-related deaths appear due to “moderate cold”. This is worth explaining, because I am not sure dying in 15C weather (60F) in Rome or Sydney is really what people will understand when they read about “cold-related deaths”! From Gasparrini et al. figure 1: Exposure–response associations as best linear unbiased prediction (with 95% empirical CI, shaded grey) in representative cities of the 13 countries, with related temperature distributions. Solid grey lines are minimum mortality temperatures and dashed grey lines are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. RR=relative risk. The other thing that is easy to see is that the risk curve generally increases slowly towards cold temperature, but a lot more steeply past high temperatures. So even if one agrees with how this study classifies and counts “cold deaths”, the fact that they outnumber heat deaths, in absolute numbers, does not necessarily mean that increasing temperatures will reduce deaths: based on these plots, it could well be that warming will reduce cold-related deaths less than it increases heat-related ones. And indeed, this is what the studies about future projection of temperature-related deaths that they cite, and that Lomborg discusses, do find. ",train,false authority,"Cold weather is more deadly than hot weather, according to a study published in The Lancet. The study found that while about 0.5% of all deaths are associated with heat, more than 7% of deaths are related to cold.

"“Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. Here … are just some of the charts to prove it.”","The four charts presented in the Breitbart article purport to demonstrate that the industrial epoch warming is simply a giant natural fluctuation. But it shows nothing of the sort; it is based on a complete misunderstanding of the space-time variability of the atmosphere. The article commits two common, but fundamental errors that totally invalidate its claims. The first two charts are both of spatially global scale (the northern hemisphere), they illustrate the time scale error. They show northern hemisphere temperatures with millennial scale fluctuations (changes) of the order of 1°C; the so-called “medieval warming event”. Irrespective of whether these reconstructions are accurate (the global—not European—extent of the warming is the question under debate), the change occurred over time scales much longer than the 1°C warming that occurred over the last century. In the pre-industrial period, typical century long, global scale temperature fluctuations were about 0.2°C (i.e. typical century to century changes, see figure below); therefore if the temperature fluctuations followed the usual “bell-curve”, then a 1°C change in a century would have a probability of about one in 3 million of occurring naturally, the giant natural fluctuation hypothesis could easily be rejected. However, it was found that the bell curve under estimates the extreme 3% of the temperature fluctuations: extreme “black swan” events occur much more frequently than expected, yet, even when these rare extremes are taken into account, the probability of a 1°C change in a century is still less than 0.1%, it can easily be rejected1. The other fundamental error is also a scale error, but now in space rather than in time. This error is well exemplified in the fourth graph which shows data indirectly reflecting temperatures in France. Yet France is only about 0.1% of the global surface area, so that large natural fluctuations are common but are not of global significance. A common “skeptic” talking point is the fact that between 1662 and 1762, the temperature in central England increased by nearly 1 °C, i.e., about the same as the global temperature over the last century. Unfortunately for the “skeptics”, central England (greater London) is about 0.01% of the earth’s surface area so that it is not surprising that over the same period, the Northern Hemisphere temperature only increased by 0.2 °C (equal to the typical centennial change!). Finally, the third graph from China combines the two errors: the times scales are way too long and the spatial scales are way too small; it is doubly irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic global warming.

"“Sea level rise is global.

While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.”","This statement touches upon several issues that are indeed discussed in the scientific literature and it is essentially correct. Let’s try and disentangle things. It is correct that Virginia Key as well as other locations on the US Atlantic coast have experienced a surge of rapid sea-level rise during the past ten years or so. However, this is a very short period in terms of sea-level variations. The longer-term rise in this region (when corrected for local land subsidence) is actually in line with the global average sea-level rise, both for the past hundred years (~1.8mm per year) or measured since the early 1990s (~3 mm per year). The recent rapid rise is thus likely a short-term natural variation (a possibility mentioned later in the article) and may well be followed by a period of very little rise. In the longer run I would expect that sea-level near Miami would continue to increase roughly in line with the global mean sea-level rise, as is indeed discussed later in the article where the future projections with their uncertainties are covered well. It is correct that local sea-level rise can differ from global sea-level rise due to “a variety of factors”, including a weakening of the Gulf Stream. For the relevant period of rapid rise, the last ten years or so, such a weakening has been documented, e.g. in the direct measurements in the RAPID section at 26 °N. So the rapid sea-level rise and the weakening of the larger Gulf Stream System coincide, and have indeed been linked.* Like with sea level, over the short time scale of the past decade this is likely to be dominated by natural variability, although there are also indications of a longer-term, probably human-caused, downward trend. Greenland melting has not caused this, but likely contributed to it. To what extent the Gulf Stream weakening explains the recent rapid sea-level rise in Miami, and to what extent other factors—like changes in the predominant winds—are responsible remains an open research question. Ezer et al (2013) Gulf Stream’s induced sea level rise and variability along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast, Journal of Geophysical Research-Oceans ",test,no fallacy,"Sea level rise is not uniform across the globe, and some regions are experiencing more significant impacts than others. In South Florida, factors such as the weakening of the Gulf Stream and the melting of Greenland's ice caps are contributing to a higher rate of sea level rise than the global average. While the worldwide mean rise has been a little over 3mm per year since the 1990s, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually in the last decade. This highlights the importance of considering regional factors when assessing the impacts of climate change.

For example, over the range of pH values which the author states are found in natural seawater, the surface pCO2 changes from 180 ppm (pH 8.3) to 1500 ppm (pH 7.5).

the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed,"The op-ed authors reference the 2017 State of the Climate Report.

This issue deserves (and has received) scrutiny.1,2,3,4,5,6 The difference in warming rates between observations and models largely arises in the early 2000s. A number of assessments have concluded that this slowdown in warming in the 2000s is in part due to natural variability (the Earth’s warming was slowed due to climate variability) and forcing (the real world experienced different solar and volcanic aerosol forcing than what was used in the models). Models do simulate natural “hiatus” periods like that experienced in the early 2000s, but, since they are random, they generally do not occur at the same times as in the real world (though some models happened to have a slowdown in warming in the early 2000s). Furthermore, forcing agents (greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar changes) are prescribed to models. Since we do not know the exact evolution of forcing agents for future projections, they are estimated. In this case, the estimated forcing was different than what occurred in the real world. When these issues are taken into account, models and observations are in agreement. Over long periods, when natural variability is a smaller issue, models and observations agree on the rate of warming. Assessments of model projections of climate change show that models have typically been quite skillful (e.g. here). 1- IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis (Ch. 9, Box 9.2) 2- Meehl et al (2014) Climate model simulations of the observed early-2000s hiatus of global warming, Nature Climate Change 3- Gleisner et al (2015) Recent global warming hiatus dominated by low‐latitude temperature trends in surface and troposphere data, Geophysical Research Letters 4- Medhaug et al (2017) Reconciling controversies about the ‘global warming hiatus’, Nature 5- Santer et al (2017) Comparing Tropospheric Warming in Climate Models and Satellite Data, Journal of Climate 6- Santer et al (2017b) Causes of differences in model and satellite tropospheric warming ",train,strawman,"TITLE: The discrepancy between climate model predictions and observations
FACT1: Climate models are complex computer simulations that use mathematical equations to predict future climate conditions based on various factors, such as greenhouse gas emissions and solar radiation. However, these models are not perfect and can have discrepancies between their predictions and actual observations.
MYTH: Climate models have predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed.
FALLACY: This myth is an example of cherry-picking, where a small amount of data is selected to support a particular argument while ignoring the larger body of evidence. While it is true that some climate models have overestimated the amount of warming that has occurred, this is not true for all models, and the overall trend still shows a significant increase in global temperatures.
FACT2: It is important to continue improving climate models and to use them as a tool to inform policy decisions and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Let's not use discrepancies between models and observations as an excuse to ignore the reality of climate change."
“over 20 years of almost no change in temperatures”,"Bastos There has been a slow-down in global mean surface (troposphere) temperatures, but this does not call into question the fact that the Earth-system as a whole is warming. In fact, during the so-called “hiatus”, the net radiation imbalance in the top of the atmosphere persisted (implying that warming would continue even if emissions were to stop). In fact, at the same time that warming in the troposphere stalled, ocean heat content increased, especially in deeper layers: The fact that oceans took more heat from the atmosphere helps to explain the slow-down of warming at the surface. This seems to be, at least partly, explained by natural variability in the ocean (see here). Trenberth* argued, thus, that natural variability in the climate system makes the global mean surface temperature record increase in steps, rather than in a linear way. In another study, Yan and colleagues* analysed the redistribution of heat during the “hiatus” period and concluded that: “[…] the term ‘global warming hiatus’ is a misnomer, although we will continue to use the widely used phrase to describe the slowdown or pause in the increase of GMST in the late 20th to early 21st century, with quotation marks. Alternatively, we would like to suggest to the climate community to use ‘global surface warming slowdown’ instead in the future to avoid confusion. There is no absolute consensus on the specific oceanic sink for the excess heat that led to the slowdown in rising GMST (the Southern Ocean may be worth further attention though), but there is a general agreement in this group and in the literature that rather than a ‘global warming hiatus,’ the slowdown of GMST increase in 1998–2013 was a result of the increased uptake of heat energy by the global ocean during those years.” Trenberth (2015) Has there been a hiatus?, Science Yan et al (2016) The global warming hiatus: Slowdown or redistribution?, Earth’s Future ",train,vagueness,"MYTH: Be wary of claims that suggest that global temperatures have not changed significantly over the past two decades.

FACT1: Both water vapor and carbon dioxide are important greenhouse gases that contribute to the Earth's climate. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, but its concentration is highly variable and short-lived. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that has been increasing in concentration due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation.

FALLACY: This myth is an example of cherry-picking, as it selectively focuses on one aspect of the greenhouse effect while ignoring the role of other greenhouse gases. While water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, its concentration is highly variable and short-lived, meaning that it cannot be responsible for long-term climate change. Carbon dioxide, on the other hand, is a long-lived greenhouse gas that has been increasing in concentration due to human activities, and its warming effect is well-established by scientific research.

FACT: Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in regulating the Earth's temperature. While it only makes up a small fraction of the atmosphere (about 0.04%), it has a powerful warming effect. Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have significantly increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, leading to global warming and climate change.

Focusing on the last decade and one tide gauge could be considered cherry-picking the data. Long-term (>60yrs) tide gauges should be used. Virginia Key has only been operational since 1994. Key West Tide gauge has been operational since 1901 and records a rate of sea-level rise of 2.37 mm/yr. ",train,cherry picking,"Sea level rise is not uniform across the globe, and some regions are experiencing more significant impacts than others. In South Florida, factors such as the weakening of the Gulf Stream and the melting of Greenland's ice caps are contributing to a higher rate of sea level rise than the global average.

“One key effect will be albedo feedback”,"Albedo is one effect, but it is moderated by cloud cover and only is effective during summer (winter gives dark “polar nights”).

FACT1: Albedo feedback is a key factor in climate change. It refers to the way that the reflectivity of the Earth's surface affects the amount of solar radiation that is absorbed by the planet. When the Earth's surface is covered in snow or ice, it reflects more solar radiation back into space, which helps to cool the planet. However, as temperatures rise and ice melts, the Earth's surface becomes less reflective, which means that more solar radiation is absorbed, leading to further warming.

“The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades.”,"Yes, variability in California precipitation appears to have been higher in the past 3-4 decades than the previous decades, but it is not (and cannot be) clear that that the variability in precipitation is actually currently in the act of increasing. I say that it cannot be clear because it takes decades of data (say 2-3) to characterize the current “variability” of the climate. Based on my calculations, variability in annual precipitation totals increased considerably during the second half of the 1900s and then has remained at this relatively high level for the past couple decades, but has not clearly continued to increase. This latest swing from record dry to very wet in the last year is consistent with high variability, but it’s a single event and not necessarily indicative of a trend. There are some logical links, however, that support the inference that wild swings like the current one should be expected to become more likely. First, droughts are becoming increasingly impacted by warming temperatures. Even if precipitation behavior didn’t change at all, years with low precipitation would correspond to less and less water availability for humans and ecosystems. Second, current climate models project variability of California precipitation to increase in the future, with an increase in the frequency of years with very high precipitation totals becoming detectable sometime in the first half of this century, and an increase in the frequency of years with very low precipitation totals becoming detectable in the second half of this century*.

California is right on the boundary between projections of drying to the south and wetting to the north. I personally believe the basic expectation that California precipitation should become more variable, but beyond that I don’t yet put much stock in what models have to say about the future of precipitation in California. So, variability has increased overall in the last century, and this is consistent with what models project to occur as a result of greenhouse-gas driven climate change. The increase in variability hasn’t been a monotonic trend, however, and it is not obvious from the data that the trend is continuing now as rapidly as it was in previous decades. This suggests that other low-frequency processes are also at play that influence decade-to-decade changes in the variability and magnitude of annual precipitation totals, making it particularly difficult to determine the degree to which this current event can be attributed to climate change. Nonetheless, California would be wise to prepare for more events like these.

"“But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.”","Regarding ice shelf stability, it is important to acknowledge (which the author didn’t do here) there are different processes at work on the Antarctic Peninsula, where the Larsen ice shelves reside(d), than on the Amundsen coast (Pine Island and Thwaites ice shelves). The Larsen A and B ice shelves were very thin, and have disintegrated from percolating surface meltwater (hydrofracturing) creating vertical cracks in the ice shelf. Larsen C is thicker and larger, but is also characterised by a relatively warm climate (many melt episodes in summer) and low snowfall (which makes it vulnerable to atmospheric warming). The ice shelves that buttress the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are much thicker, annual snowfall rates are very large, and surface melt rates are substantially lower than on the (former) Larsen ice shelves (3-5 times lower). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that surface-based ice shelf instability will occur within the next few decades—instead, these ice shelves would likely thin through contact with warmer oc",dev,post hoc,"Melting ice shelves can have a cascading effect on the stability of ice further inland. This is supported by examples such as the Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, which collapsed due to warming temperatures.

“[CO2] is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature.”,"While the presence of CO2 has warmed the atmosphere to “habitable” temperatures, the additional increase of it will bring temperatures way outside habitable ranges in many regions including the oceans, as well as disturbing the water cycle and acidifying the oceans.",train,cherry picking,"TITLE: The Role of CO2 in Earth's Temperature
FACT1: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring gas in the Earth's atmosphere that plays a crucial role in regulating the planet's temperature. It acts as a greenhouse gas, trapping heat from the sun and preventing it from escaping back into space. Without greenhouse gases like CO2, the Earth's average temperature would be too cold to support life as we know it.

FALLACY: This myth is an oversimplification of the role of CO2 in the Earth's temperature. While it is true that excessive amounts of CO2 can contribute to global warming and climate change, it is also true that a certain amount of CO2 is necessary to maintain a habitable temperature on Earth. The key is to maintain a balance of CO2 in the atmosphere.

"“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases.

It is the ability of a gas to absorb radiation, and so affect energy balance of the Earth, not its concentration, which is important. This effect on Earth’s energy balance can be quantified by the radiative forcing (RF); a positive RF means a surface warming effect and a negative RF a cooling. The figure below, from the 2013 IPCC report shows estimates of RF for a range of factors which have influenced climate from 1750-2011. As can be seen, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations have the largest RF and therefore the largest impact on climate.

The other factors are the extent of exposure, the vulnerability of the exposed population, and the capacity of individuals and communities to prepare for and manage heatwaves.

"“That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,” first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the surface[…]This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the ‘Skeleton Coast.’”","Ocean acidification per se doesn’t enhance anoxia: anoxia (loss of oxygen) results from warming (warm water holds less dissolved gas like oxygen), which would be the consequence of atmospheric CO2 buildup, as might more sluggish ocean mixing. It also is enhanced by increased nutrient delivery to the ocean from more rain and river flow on land under the warmer climate. More nutrients mean more algae growth in the uppermost ocean, more decaying organic matter below the surface, and thus less oxygen. Low oxygen zones would spread as the ocean became warmer and river flow increased as the event progressed. When oxygen is exhausted, bacteria do “breathe” other oxygen-containing compounds including sulfate and respire hydrogen sulfide. The coast of Namibia does experience these extreme conditions episodically, but such conditions are unlikely to spread globally until centuries to millennia of warming and eutrophication have occurred. Hydrogen sulfide likely contributed to the mass extinction, but the warming itself as well as other volcanic emanations like chlorine, fluorine, and sulfur dioxide were equally if not more important drivers of the extinction. The recovery from the extinction did take millions of years.",dev,false cause,"TITLE: Ocean Acidification and Dead Zones
FACT1: Ocean acidification can lead to the growth of dead zones in the ocean, which can harm marine life and fisheries.

Dead zones can grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries.

“Here’s an unusual one from Guillet et al suggesting that there’s nothing new about wildly early or late grape harvests through the centuries,"The Guillet et al paper primarily uses wine grapes to look at the impact of the 1257 Samalas eruption (volcanic aerosols cool the climate, delaying grape maturation and harvest). I haven’t read the paper in the detail, but as far as I can tell they do not make any claims about recent warming or harvest trends. Contrary to the claim quoted above, our own work suggest that warming has significantly advanced wine grape harvests over western Europe1. We found, on average, that winegrape harvests have been occurring significantly earlier since 1980 (on average 10 days earlier than the 1600-1900 average).

"“But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.”","Enhanced stratification of the water column is indeed one mechanism that can explain the decrease in subsurface oxygen, notably in the tropics[1]. As the upper-layer of the ocean warms faster than the deeper layers, the temperature stratification increases, with the already-warm upper layer getting warmer. This enhanced thermal stratification acts as a barrier to vertical mixing, since warmer water is less dense (like when a low density fluid (e.g. oil) tops a high density fluid (e.g. water)). This stratification can prevent oxygen coming from the surface from reaching deeper layers where it gets depleted by biological activity (respiration). As climate change proceeds, the upper-ocean layer is also expected to become fresher (less salty) in the tropics as rainfall increase, further increasing the upper-ocean stratification[2].

“Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today”,"This is the biggest opportunity to add more depth to the analysis of this new Antarctic ice loss result. An important point here is that the human fingerprint on this Antarctic mass loss is still hard to identify. A 2013 assessment1 showed that expert opinion is “uncertain and undecided” about whether recent ice sheet behavior simply reflects natural variability or is a response to human-caused climate change. This is essentially because our observations of ice sheet behavior are too short, 30 years at best for satellite observations of the ice sheet. This just meets the minimum definition of a “climatology” with respect to the atmosphere, and we know that the ice sheet operates on longer timescales than the atmosphere (it is a big system to move!). Although West Antarctica has been one of the fastest-warming places on the planet over the last 60 years (sparse weather records begin in 1957), as Steig et al showed in 20092 and Bromwich et al confirmed in 20133, how/whether this atmospheric warming has emerged from natural climate variability is less clear. It is also unclear how this warming trend will continue, as climate in West Antarctica is pushed around by Pacific Ocean-atmosphere variability. From ice core records we (myself and MANY others) have drilled and analyzed across this region we do not see recent anomalies exceeding variability over the last 2000 years4. From measurements of ice borehole temperatures in the same region, the ice itself directly records anomalous warmth over the last 50 years5. Antarctic weather is known to be harsh but it is also some of the most variable on the planet. The human fingerprint of atmospheric warming has emerged everywhere else on the planet as early as about 200 years ago, but we are still waiting for it to clearly emerge in Antarctica (see Figure 2 in Abram et al, 20166). As Mooney explains, how much atmospheric warming comes to Antarctica largely depends on our carbon emission choices in the near-term. In addition to all of this, the ice loss in West Antarctica is less driven by ocean warming as it is by increased delivery of relatively-warm deep ocean currents beneath ice shelves. This delivery is driven by the atmosphere; whether winds blow strong enough in the right direction to drive upwelling currents beneath Pacific-facing West Antarctic ice shelves. Decadal-scale variability of the Pacific Ocean-atmosphere system in turn affect the strength and position of these current-driving winds. Summary: it’s very complicated but the Pacific Ocean is the beast to watch for future West Antarctic ice loss, in combination with the dynamics of Pine Island, Thwaites, and a few smaller glaciers (Smith, Kohler) along the Amundsen Sea coast of West Antarctica. 1-Bamber and Aspinall (2013) An expert judgement assessment of future sea level rise from the ice sheets, Nature Climate Change 2-Steig et al (2019) Warming of the Antarctic ice-sheet surface since the 1957 International Geophysical Year, Nature 3-Bromwich et al (2013) Central West Antarctica among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, Nature Geoscience 4-Steig et al (2013) Recent climate and ice-sheet changes in West Antarctica compared with the past 2,000 years, Nature Geoscience 5-Orsi et al (2012) Little Ice Age cold interval in West Antarctica: Evidence from borehole temperature at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide, Geophysical Research Letters 6-Abram et al (2016) Early onset of industrial-era warming across the oceans and continents, Nature ",test,cherry picking,"TITLE: The impact of current choices on Antarctic mass loss

what this study proves is that there is nothing we can do to stop the Earth’s naturally occurring climate cycles.,"This study does absolutely no such thing. Its topic wasn’t even related to showing climate cycles—the subject of the paper is looking at the effect on CO2 of ice sheets scraping soil and weathered rock off the Earth’s surface over ice ages. CO2 rise and warming that is happening now is entirely something that we have caused (see here for some helpful pointers).

FACT1: The Earth's climate has undergone natural cycles of warming and cooling for millions of years, long before humans existed. These cycles are caused by a variety of factors, including changes in the Earth's orbit, solar radiation, and volcanic activity. 
MYTH: Misunderstanding that there is nothing we can do to stop the Earth's naturally occurring climate cycles.
FALLACY: This statement is a false dichotomy, presenting only two options when there are actually many actions we can take to mitigate the effects of climate change. It also ignores the fact that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are contributing to the current warming trend and exacerbating the natural cycles.

",train,false analogy,"TITLE: Acidification of Oceans and its Effects on Marine Life and Humans
FACT1: Oceans absorb about 30% of the carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, which leads to a decrease in pH levels, making the water more acidic. This process is known as ocean acidification. Acidification can have severe consequences for marine life, especially for organisms that rely on calcium carbonate to build their shells and skeletons. Additionally, it can also have harmful effects on human health.
MYTH: None
FALLACY: The statement highlights the effects of ocean acidification on marine life and human health, which are scientifically proven. However, it does not provide any evidence to support the claim that this phenomenon is not happening or that it is not caused by human activities. The statement is not a fallacy, but it could be misleading if it is used to deny the reality of ocean acidification.

"“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.”","First, it is true that water vapor constitutes the bulk of Earth’s present-day greenhouse effect (measured in terms of infrared absorption). Quantitatively, however, Jacoby is off by quite a bit. In fact, water vapor constitutes ~50% of the terrestrial greenhouse effect, not 95% (see here*). Clouds (solid and liquid water that form when the vapor condenses) constitute another ~25%, but CO2 contributes to almost all of the remaining fraction (only ~5% or so from all of the other combined gases). This is because CO2 still absorbs well in spectral regions where water vapor doesn’t, and also because the upper troposphere is very dry; the ability to absorb intense surface emission and re-emit it at colder, higher layers of the atmosphere is critical for the maintenance of a planetary greenhouse effect. Secondly, the water vapor greenhouse effect is not independent of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Jacoby stresses that CO2 is only a trace component of the atmosphere, an argument that is irritatingly unoriginal and provides useless context when describing the flow of radiation through the atmosphere. As before, CO2 accounts for ~20% of Earth’s greenhouse effect. N2 and O2 account for nearly all of Earth’s atmospheric mass. However, if the atmosphere were purely N2 and O2, the planet would likely be in a snowball state due to the lack of greenhouse trapping. This is where the equations of radiative transfer must be applied, rather than a naive intuition about proportions.

FACT1: Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere, accounting for about 95% of the greenhouse effect. It is a natural component of the atmosphere and is constantly changing due to the Earth's water cycle.
MYTH: CO2 is not a significant greenhouse gas because it is only a trace component in the atmosphere.
FALLACY: This argument uses the false equivalence fallacy by comparing the abundance of water vapor to the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. While water vapor is more abundant, CO2 is still a significant greenhouse gas because it absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere.

In fact, from the scientific literature it seems the phenomenon is more likely to take place during the period 2040-2060. Of course, a very low probability does not necessarily mean a zero probability, and IPCC’s report could possibly underestimate the odds for disappearance within the next few years. But before propagating a marginal view (relative to IPCC conclusions), one should ensure having a very strong argumentation; in this interview no argumentation is put forward to support Peter Wadhams’ central claim.

"“Although the extent of the summer sea ice after 2006 dropped abruptly to levels not expected until 2050, the predicted 67-per-cent decline in polar bear numbers simply didn’t happen. Rather, global polar bear numbers have been stable or slightly improved.”","This is nonsense. No polar bear scientist has predicted a drop in polar bear abundance based on summer sea ice. We base the assessment of loss on duration of the ice-free period. Papers1,2 from our research group assess this point. The statement about global polar bear numbers is absolutely unfounded. It is a contrived statement using population estimates provided so that children (or the general public) could give a number of polar bears in the world for school reports and the like. Castro de la Guarida1 states, “Sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering physical characteristics of marine ecosystems. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have been identified as vulnerable to changes in sea ice conditions. We use sea ice projections for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from 2006 – 2100 to gain insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears with respect to habitat loss using metrics developed from polar bear energetics modeling. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Shifts away from multiyear ice to annual ice cover throughout the region, as well as lengthening ice-free periods, may become critical for polar bears before the end of the 21st century with projected warming. Each polar bear population in the Archipelago may undergo 2-5 months of ice-free conditions, where no such conditions exist presently. We identify spatially and temporally explicit ice-free periods that extend beyond what polar bears require for nutritional and reproductive demands. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under business-as-usual climate projections, polar bears may face starvation and reproductive failure across the entire Archipelago by the year 2100.” Both of these studies1,2 assess the threat to polar bears based on projected sea ice loss over the next 3 generations (ca. 33-45 years). It is an issue of fasting duration that causes polar bear population declines and this is well understood in the published literature. Dr. Crockford is following the standard climate change denier approach of picking on a specific detail and then contriving an unsubstantiated fictional account on that point. Loss of sea ice in summer is, by and large, irrelevant. It’s the duration of the ice-free period that matters. If not, polar bears in Hudson Bay would have disappeared hundreds or thousands of years ago but they didn’t because they used to be able to obtain sufficient fat stores while hunting seals on the sea ice in spring. The situation is changing but the best estimate is that we’ll have significant declines in the Western Hudson Bay population (beyond the current ca. 30% decline) by mid-century. By repeating it often enough, it appears that deniers or the uninformed think there’s some merit to the issue Dr. Crockford has raised. Nobody can scientifically rebut the flawed thesis because it isn’t published. My understanding was that the manuscript was rejected by scientific journals so now Dr. Crockford’s manuscript languishes as an unreviewed “Preprint” in PeerJ and she erroneously calls it a “paper”. 1- Castro de la Guardia et al (2013) Future sea ice conditions in western Hudson Bay and consequences for polar bears in the 21st century, Global Change Biology 2- Regehr et al (2016) Conservation status of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) in relation to projected sea-ice declines, Biology Letters ",dev,no fallacy,"FACT1: Global polar bear populations have remained stable or slightly improved, despite a significant decline in summer sea ice after 2006.

“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm”,"Climate change doesn’t cause events like this, but probably makes them worse by making storms (which are strong to begin with) more intense and enhancing rainfall in that process.

It is consistent with what’s predicted for the future, though. However, I’m not exactly sure where the “30 percent” number comes from for the human contribution to rainfall. For every one degree increase in sea surface temperature, the saturation vapor pressure increases by about 7% based on the “Clausius-Clapeyron” equation.

"“The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”","This statement is absolutely ridiculous. It violates the most basic, fundamental maxim of toxicology, first articulated by the Renaissance physician Paracelsus: “The dose makes the poison.” Or, “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.” In other words, just because a substance at one concentration is harmless does not mean it is harmless at another concentration. We don’t normally think of consumption of water as harmful to humans, but at high enough doses it will kill—and has done so. A pollutant is generally defined as a substance—artificial (synthetic) or natural—that occurs in the environment at least in part because of human activity, and that has a deleterious impact on living systems. Given that basic definition, there is no way that CO2 can not be a pollutant. It is produced by a variety of human activities, but principally burning of fossil fuels. Increases in its concentration are clearly linked to global warming, which has already, and increasingly will, negatively affect living systems, including humans. The only exit from this logic is to deny that CO2 leads to warming (in contradiction to massive scientific evidence) or to deny that warming negatively impacts living systems (again in contradiction to massive evidence). The authors use a classic rhetorical ploy to confound bits of information and draw erroneous conclusions. Yes, at low concentrations CO2 is not directly harmful to humans, and in fact is required by plants. And yes, small increases in CO2 have been shown to increase plant growth. (Some of my own work has shown such; such increases also shift the chemical composition of plant tissues, and not always for the better!). Plants grown under elevated CO2 do grow faster. To my knowledge, there is no evidence that they are “stronger” (whatever that means), and if anything, they are less green. Nor is there convincing evidence they are healthier.

FACT1: Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere, and it plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's temperature. As temperatures rise, the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere also increases, which can lead to a positive feedback loop that amplifies warming.
MYTH: Dr. Willie Soon's comparison of temperature data and water vapor suggests that water vapor is the primary driver of climate change, rather than human activities like burning fossil fuels.
FALLACY: Dr. Soon's comparison commits the fallacy of cherry-picking by focusing on a single variable (water vapor) while ignoring other factors that contribute to climate change, such as greenhouse gas emissions from human activities. This oversimplification leads to a false equivalence between water vapor and human-caused climate change.
FACT2: While water vapor is an important factor in regulating the Earth's temperature, it is not the primary driver of climate change.

FACT1: The record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were primarily caused by the El Nino weather pattern, which is a natural phenomenon that occurs every few years. El Nino is characterized by warmer than average sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, which can lead to changes in global weather patterns.
MYTH: Professor Judith Curry claims that the record warm years of 2015 and 2016 were caused by El Nino, not human activity.
FALLACY: This argument is a red herring, as it diverts attention away from the overwhelming scientific consensus that human activity is the primary cause of global warming. While El Nino can contribute to short-term temperature increases, it does not explain the long-term warming trend that has been observed over the past century.

FACT: Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in regulating the Earth's temperature. While it makes up only a small fraction of the atmosphere (about 0.04%), it has a powerful warming effect.

FACT1: NASA scientists have observed that the Earth is getting greener, especially in the rapidly warming northern regions. This is due to the increase in carbon dioxide in the air, warmer temperatures, and longer growing seasons, which are all factors that make plants thrive.
MYTH: Earth getting greener means climate change isn't happening.

FACT1: Arctic sea ice is declining at an alarming rate, with the extent of sea ice in September 2020 being the second-lowest on record. This decline is due to human-caused climate change, which is causing the Arctic to warm at a rate twice as fast as the rest of the world. The loss of Arctic sea ice has significant consequences for the climate, wildlife, and people who depend on the Arctic ecosystem.
MYTH: The myth is that the decline of Arctic sea ice is a myth, and that predictions of global disaster resulting from its demise have been proven wrong.
FALLACY: The myth is based on cherry-picking a single prediction made by one scientist and using it to dismiss the overwhelming evidence of Arctic sea ice decline. This is a form of cherry-picking fallacy, where one piece of information is selected to support a preconceived conclusion while ignoring the larger body of evidence.

“But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.”,"The statement is fairly accurate but leaves the inference of causes up to the reader. A recent paper by Santer et al. (2016)* investigated this issue in considerable detail. For middle tropospheric temperatures the paper found that, on average, models showed 1.71 times more warming than the mean of the most recent version of the satellite data for the 1979-2015 period. This is for near global mean temperatures. For the lower troposphere, the models show about 2 times more warming than the satellites. Note that the Remote Sensing Systems lower tropospheric dataset has not yet been upgraded to the latest version, which is likely to show more warming. The article does not discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, but given the tone of the rest of the article, the reader is expected to use the trend differences as evidence that long-term projections by climate models are suspect. These ratios do not provide such evidence. At least part of the discrepancy is known to be caused by errors in the forcings used to drive the CMIP-5 climate models. After the year 2000, the CMIP-5 models were driven by forecast values for important parameters such as volcanic aerosols, solar output, and stratospheric ozone. The forecasts turned out to be slightly inaccurate, causing the models to predict more warming than they would have if the correct forcings had been used. (Of course, these correct forcings were in the future and thus unknowable at the time the model computations were performed). Other possible causes include natural variability in the real world (which might produce a period of reduced warming) and errors in the model physics. Only errors in the model physics would cause long-term global warming to be overestimated, and there is no significant evidence that supports large errors in the model physics. Over a much longer time period, 1880-present, the warming at the surface agrees well with that expected by the CMIP-5 models. The longer time period is important because the effects of random fluctuations due to natural variability tend to average away as the time period considered gets longer. Santer et al. (2016) Comparing tropospheric warming In climate models and satellite data, Journal of Climate",test,vagueness,"Satellites are not the only way to monitor global temperatures, and they have limitations.

If we go hundreds of millions of years back, the Sun was less strong than today. So yes, there might have been ice with higher CO2 concentrations and a faint Sun, but who knows? CO2 reconstructions do not go that far back.",train,no fallacy,"TITLE: Ice ages have occurred in the past despite high atmospheric carbon dioxide levels
FACT1: Ice ages have occurred in the past, even when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were high. This suggests that other factors, such as changes in the Earth's orbit or solar radiation, played a role in causing these ice ages.
MYTH: High atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the past prevented ice ages from occurring.
FALLACY: This myth is an example of oversimplification, assuming that a single factor (carbon dioxide levels) is solely responsible for causing ice ages. In reality, ice ages are caused by a complex interplay of factors, including changes in the Earth's orbit, solar radiation, and greenhouse gas concentrations.

So in addition to all the devastating and obvious effects sea-level rise will produce on the planet, such as flooding and erosion, sea-level rise also has the more subtle, but nonetheless mind-boggling ability to alter the way the Earth rotates on its axis. In a recent paper, Jerry Mitrovica and an interdisciplinary team of colleagues claim to have resolved the enigma.

"“there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought”","This sentence is true for RSS data, but it’s somewhat misleading due to lack of context. If you look at the two most recent versions of the RSS data and compute linear trends Jan 1998-Dec 2016, you find that the new version has a trend value for this period of about 2.6 times larger than the previous version. But, it is good to remember that 1998 is a favorite starting point for those that seek to minimize the perceived threat of global warming. This preference is because 1998 is a relative maximum in global temperature (due to a large ENSO event), and thus trends that start in Jan 1998 are smaller than trends that start in other, nearby years. This means that when the change in trends between datasets is reported as a multiplicative effect, the change appears quite large. However, if one calculated the trends for Jan 1999-Dec 2016 instead, the trends increases by a factor of about 1.6, not 2.6, only a 60% increase. Of course this is still a pretty large increase.

The authors of the study admit on pages 10-11 to making the astonishing assumption that every other country in the world ignores the targets in their nationally determined contributions and make no further efforts to reduce emissions, so that much of the calculated costs to the United States economy subsequently arise from high-carbon companies relocate or lose business to competitors in other countries. The model assumes no increase in low-carbon electricity generation over the next four decades compared with the baseline scenario, so no increase in economic growth or jobs in the low-carbon sector and no substitution of low-carbon energy for high-carbon energy—emissions reductions are achieved by imposing very high carbon prices that reduce the consumption of coal and energy.

If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?”","Proxy analysis has clearly shown an acceleration in rate of sea-level rise. Our research* found that the rate of sea-level rise on the US Atlantic coast is greater now than at any time in the past 2,000 years. The research also shows a consistent link between global mean surface temperature and changes in sea level for the past millennium. The study shows that after relatively subtle changes in temperature and sea-level rise over the last 2,000 years, the rate of sea-level rise increased in the late 19th century. Sea-level rise contributes significantly to the frequency of flooding from hurricanes. The contribution from sea-level rise to flood height works in together with other factors such as timing of the storm relative to high tide, and the strength and direction of individual hurricanes. Sea-level rise between hurricanes raises the “baseline” water level and makes flooding more likely. We published another paper* showing that New York City can expect nine-foot floods, as intense as that produced by 2012’s Superstorm Sandy, at least four times more frequently over the next century. We report that floods as intense as Sandy’s would have occurred about once every 400 years on average under present day sea-level rise conditions, but that over the 21st century are expected to be about four times more probable (once every 100 years) due to an acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise.

FACT1: Sea level rise is a gradual increase in the average level of the ocean, caused by melting glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the thermal expansion of seawater due to global warming. It is a real threat to coastal communities, causing flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources. 
MYTH: Sea level rise is not a significant threat because it has been occurring naturally for a long time and has not accelerated. 
FALLACY: This argument uses the false equivalence fallacy by equating the natural, gradual sea level rise that has occurred over thousands of years with the rapid, human-caused sea level rise that is happening now. It also uses the cherry-picking fallacy by focusing on the rate of sea level rise over a short period of time and ignoring the long-term trend.

FACT1: Climate scientists use different methods to estimate the amount of energy that is being absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere and surface. One method is called Energy Balance, which estimates the amount of energy based on measurements of incoming and outgoing radiation. Another method is based on computer models that simulate the Earth's climate system. These models take into account a wide range of factors that affect the Earth's energy balance, such as greenhouse gas concentrations, solar radiation, and cloud cover.

MYTH: Energy Balance estimates of climate change are more accurate than model-based estimates.

FALLACY: The fallacy underlying this myth is a false dichotomy, which presents two options as the only possibilities when other possibilities exist. In reality, both Energy Balance and model-based estimates have their strengths and weaknesses, and scientists use both methods to gain a more complete understanding of climate change. Energy Balance estimates are based on direct measurements, but they are limited by the availability and quality of data. Model-based estimates are based on complex simulations, but they are limited by the accuracy of the models and the assumptions that are built into them.

FACT2: Both Energy Balance and model-based estimates are important tools for understanding climate change. By using multiple methods and comparing results, scientists can gain a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the Earth's energy balance and how it is changing over time.

FACT1: Post-glacial rebound is the process by which land masses rise after the weight of ice sheets has been removed. This is due to the fact that the Earth's mantle is viscous and responds to changes in surface loads. As the ice melts, the weight is removed, and the mantle slowly flows back into the space previously occupied by the ice, causing the land to rise.
MYTH: The rising of continents after the ice melts is not well understood and may be due to other factors.
FALLACY: The myth is based on a lack of understanding of the process of post-glacial rebound. While there are other factors that can affect land elevation, such as tectonic activity and erosion, post-glacial rebound is a well-established process that has been observed in many parts of the world.

“The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero.”,"he current understanding of interactions between the global carbon cycle and the climate system is that when global CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, the warming will remain approximately constant. This is very often confused by estimates of committed “warming in the pipeline” which instead of assuming that global emissions are reduced to zero, assume that concentrations (and therewith to a large degree forcing) are kept constant. Keeping CO2 concentrations constant would require continuous emissions of CO2 that perfectly counter the uptake by natural sinks. If CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, atmospheric CO2 concentrations will gradually decline. For heat-trapping emissions other than CO2, the requirement to reduce them to zero to stabilize warming depends on their residence time in the atmosphere. For gases and particles that only stay in the atmosphere for shorter time periods (days to a decade) achieving constant emissions would also achieve approximately stabilized warming.",train,vagueness,"TITLE: The Warming Will Continue Even with Reduced Emissions

"“‘That isn’t going to sound horribly unmanageable. But remember for the northern hemisphere, for North America, the fact that the location in West Antarctica is where the action is amplifies that rate of sea level rise by up to an about additional 25 percent in a city like Boston or New York.’ That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”","What Rob DeConto and Chris Mooney explain here are the “far-field” sea level rise effects of losing so much concentrated ice mass in West Antarctica. This loss of mass reduces the gravitational pull that Antarctica otherwise has on the ocean, causing more water to slosh away from the far South. This just so happens to have a maximum impact on both coasts of North America, as illustrated in the Climate Science Special Report released in 2017 as part of the 4th National Climate Assessment undertaken by US federal agencies and universities.

In the past, rates of volcanic CO2 emissions globally were higher as continental spreading rates changed, for example.

“The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years.”,"This is not per se completely incorrect, but the author does not tell us the whole story. The author refers to the growing of the ice sheet volume through snowfall throughout winter. The snow accumulated on Greenland in past winter (September-April) has indeed been remarkably high: However, this does not imply that the volume of the ice sheet is increasing, because (1) the ice sheet also loses ice through discharging icebergs; it is the difference between snowfall-driven growth and solid ice discharge that determines if the ice sheet gains or loses volume, and (2) the snow that accumulated during the winter will (at least partly) melt over the summer. That’s why we analyse changes to the ice sheet volume/mass on (at least) annual time scales. Only after the summer we will know how much of the accumulated snow has (not) been melted. uring the past years, the amount of melting has been record-high, and much of snow that accumulated over the winter melted and ran off into the ocean. Concurrently, ice discharge continued, so the Greenland ice sheet LOST considerable volume. We will know in September how much the ice sheet has changed volume this year. Two additional remarks: (a) The word “faster” should not have been used here. We are not talking about the rate of speed, but rather about the total change in volume. Also, it is easier to talk about “mass changes” than “volume changes” since the former is not sensitive to the density of the medium we are talking about (snow has a lower density than ice!). (b) The enhanced snowfall, ironically, is most probably also a signal of the strongly warming Arctic: as the atmosphere warms, it contains more moisture, and generates more precipitation. Also, record-low fall and winter sea ice extent led to large streaks of open water that might have contributed to additional moisture loading of the air.",train,cherry picking,"TITLE: Greenland's Ice Cap is Melting Despite Winter Gains
FACT1: Greenland's ice sheet is melting at an alarming rate, contributing to rising sea levels. While it is true that the ice cap increased in volume last winter, this is a temporary and insignificant gain compared to the overall trend of melting.
MYTH: The Greenland ice cap is not melting because it gained volume last winter.
FALLACY: This statement uses the cherry-picking fallacy by focusing on a single event (the winter gain) while ignoring the larger trend of melting. It also uses the ambiguity fallacy by not providing context for the winter gain, which was caused by increased snowfall rather than a decrease in melting.

"“The ocean has accelerated and is now rising at a rate of about a foot per century[…] The risk is that the rate will increase still more. Scientists who study the Earth’s history say waters could rise by a foot per decade in a worst-case scenario, though that looks unlikely. Many experts believe that even if emissions stopped tomorrow, 15 or 20 feet of sea level rise is already inevitable, enough to flood many cities unless trillions of dollars are spent protecting them. How long it will take is unclear. But if emissions continue apace, the ultimate rise could be 80 or 100 feet.”","It is accurate to say sea-level rise is approximately one foot per century. Present-day sea-level rise is a major indicator of climate change. Since the early 1990s, sea level rose at a mean rate of ~3.1 mm/yr (~1 foot over 100 years). It is virtually certain that global mean sea level rise will continue for many centuries beyond 2100, with the amount of rise dependent on future emissions. The latest IPCC report estimates 1 to more than 3 m (up to ~10 feet) for high emission scenarios by 2300. But, those projections of sea-level rise may be limited by uncertainties surrounding the response of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. For example, the report projected a likely contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) of -8 to +15 cm under the high emissions scenario by 2100, but a recent coupled ice sheet and climate dynamics model suggests that the AIS could contribute more than 1 m by 2100, and more than 10 m by 2300, under that high emissions scenario.",train,no fallacy,"TITLE: The Rising Sea Levels: A Fact-Based Overview

This carbon uptake and release is more or less balanced at the annual scale, and net ecosystem emissions are even negative. Without these ecosystems, atmospheric CO2 concentration would have risen even more as a consequence of fossil fuel burning; the CO2 concentration in the air would already be around 550 ppm (instead of the current ~400 ppm). Hence, it is absolutely misleading to compare amounts of CO2 cycling through the ecosystems with human CO2 emissions in this context.

“the climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming ‘hiatus’”,"Recent media headlines have again discussed the issue of whether climate models are overly sensitive to greenhouse gases. These headlines have misinterpreted a study by Millar et al. which was discussing carbon budgets to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. A recent study by Medhaug et al. analysed the issue of how the models have performed against recent observations at length and largely reconciled the issue. An overly simplistic comparison of simulated global temperatures and observations might suggest that the models were warming too much, but this would be wrong for a number of reasons. In the Medhaug et al. paper they show the range of models (blue shading in figure with median in light blue), compared with the HadCRUT4 observations and their estimated uncertainty (orange shading with light orange line). There are a number of well understood reasons why the light orange line might not follow the light blue line, namely: radiative forcings, variability, observational biases and choice of reference period.

FACT1: The Earth's climate has continued to warm over the past few decades, despite a temporary slowdown in the rate of warming from the late 1990s to the early 2010s. This slowdown, often referred to as the ""warming hiatus,"" was caused by natural climate variability, such as changes in ocean circulation patterns and volcanic eruptions, and does not contradict the long-term trend of global warming.
MYTH: Warning that a misunderstanding is coming. ""The climate models have overestimated the amount of global warming and failed to predict what climatologists call the warming 'hiatus.'""
FALLACY: The myth is based on cherry-picking a short-term trend and ignoring the long-term trend of global warming. The warming hiatus was a temporary slowdown in the rate of warming caused by natural climate variability, not a long-term cooling trend. Climate models have accurately predicted the long-term trend of global warming, and continue to do so.
FACT2: Let's not be misled by the warming hiatus myth. The long-term trend of global warming is clear and supported by scientific evidence."

FACT1: Ice sheets can respond to changing climates much faster than previously thought. Research has shown that ice sheets can respond within decades, rather than millennia, to changes in temperature and other environmental factors. This means that the effects of climate change on ice sheets can be seen much sooner than previously anticipated.
MYTH: Scientists used to think that ice sheets could take millennia to respond to changing climates.
FALLACY: This myth is an example of a false belief based on outdated information. It is a form of slothful induction, where relevant evidence is ignored when coming to a conclusion. The myth ignores recent research that has shown that ice sheets can respond much more quickly to changing climates than previously thought.
FACT2: Let's not underestimate the speed at which ice sheets can respond to changing climates. It is important to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow the pace of climate change to prevent further damage to our planet."
“That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen.”,"This sentence somehow implies that deforesting the Amazon would reduce atmospheric oxygen by 20%. This is not true. To quote Wally Broecker, who is cited later in the article: “Simply put, our atmosphere is endowed with such an enormous reserve of this gas that even if we were to burn all our fossil fuel reserves, all our trees, and all the organic matter stored in soils, we would use up only a few percent of the available O2. No matter how foolishly we treat our environmental heritage, we simply don’t have the capacity to put more than a small dent in our O2 supply. Furthermore, the Earth’s forests do not play a dominant role in maintaining O2 reserves, because they consume just as much of this gas as they produce. In the tropics, ants, termites, bacteria, and fungi eat nearly the entire photosynthetic O2 product. Only a tiny fraction of the organic matter they produce accumulates in swamps and soils or is carried down the rivers for burial on the sea floor.”",train,no fallacy,"TITLE: The Amazon Rainforest and Oxygen Production
FACT1: The Amazon Rainforest is a vital ecosystem that produces a significant amount of the world's oxygen.

FALLACY: This myth is an example of an appeal to emotion fallacy, as it plays on people's fears of losing a vital resource. While the Amazon Rainforest is important for oxygen production, it is not the only source of oxygen, and the 20% figure is an exaggeration. 
FACT2: While the exact amount of oxygen produced by the Amazon Rainforest is difficult to measure, it is estimated to be around 6% of the world's oxygen. It is important to protect the Amazon Rainforest and other ecosystems for their ecological value, but we should not rely on exaggerated claims to make the case for conservation."

MYTH: A warning that a misunderstanding is coming. ""Climate models did not predict what actually happened because carbon dioxide was assumed to be the only factor driving climate change.""
FALLACY: This is a false cause fallacy, as it assumes that the failure of climate models to predict climate change is solely due to the assumption that carbon dioxide is the only factor driving climate change. In reality, climate models take into account a wide range of factors that affect climate change, including carbon dioxide, clouds, back-radiation, and the sun. The failure of some climate models to accurately predict climate change is due to the complexity of the Earth's climate system and the limitations of current modeling techniques.

"“Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”","This is flawed reasoning as it is not a sensible analogy for how the greenhouse effect works. The science is more complex: Namely, radiation from the surface at a warmer temperature is absorbed in the layers above which are at a colder temperature; the colder layers emit less radiation so that there is a net loss of radiative energy escaping to space from the atmosphere-surface system as a whole, but coming about due to the “exchange” as formulated. This is true in absorption bands that are transparent and not opaque—i.e., in bands that are not saturated. In bands that are opaque, the radiation emanating from the layer to space represents a “cooling-to-space” and this too represents a “trapping”. In this regard, the lapse-rate and decrease of temperature with height (in the troposphere) are important. The more CO2 that is added to the atmosphere, the more heat that is “trapped” in the climate system, although it is not 1:1 and is instead a logarithmic relationship. However, regardless of the rate, we still have more warming with more CO2—that is unequivocally true.",test,false analogy,"TITLE: Diminishing Returns of CO2

"“while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.”","There is evidence. Bromaghin et al 20151 and Hunter et al 20102 examine this issue. Bromaghin et al state, “Low survival from 2004 through 2006 led to a 25–50% decline in abundance. We hypothesize that low survival during this period resulted from (1) unfavorable ice conditions that limited access to prey during multiple seasons; and possibly, (2) low prey abundance. For reasons that are not clear, survival of adults and cubs began to improve in 2007 and abundance was comparatively stable from 2008 to 2010, with ~900 bears in 2010 (90% CI 606–1212). However, survival of subadult bears declined throughout the entire period. Reduced spatial and temporal availability of sea ice is expected to increasingly force population dynamics of polar bears as the climate continues to warm. However, in the short term, our findings suggest that factors other than sea ice can influence survival.” Hunter et al stated, “Deterministic models projected population growth in years with more extensive ice coverage (2001-2003) and population decline in years with less ice coverage (2004-2005). LTRE (life table response experiment) analysis showed that the reduction in lambda in years with low sea ice was due primarily to reduced adult female survival, and secondarily to reduced breeding. A stochastic model with two environmental states, good and poor sea ice conditions, projected a declining stochastic growth rate, log lambda(s), as the frequency of poor ice years increased. The observed frequency of poor ice years since 1979 would imply log lambda(s) approximate to -0.01, which agrees with available (albeit crude) observations of population size. The stochastic model was linked to a set of 10 GCMs compiled by the IPCC; the models were chosen for their ability to reproduce historical observations of sea ice and were forced with “business as usual” (A1B) greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting stochastic population projections showed drastic declines in the polar bear population by the end of the 21st century. These projections were instrumental in the decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the U. S.

It is often claimed that 93% of the Great Barrier Reef has been devastated by coral bleaching.

FALLACY: The claim that 93% of the Great Barrier Reef has been devastated by coral bleaching is an example of cherry-picking. While it is true that some areas of the reef have been severely affected by coral bleaching, the 93% figure refers specifically to the northern section of the reef, which is only a small portion of the entire reef system.

"“In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.”","It depends on the type of event. heatwaves and extreme heat events have increased since at least the 1950s1. Though tropical cyclones and drought are a bit harder to analyse since natural climate variability also plays a large role. This means there may be a signal of change due to human activity, but is more difficult to measure, due to the noise of the natural variability of the climate.

While it is true that sea levels continue to rise at a steady rate, it is also true that warming is causing the rate of sea-level rise to accelerate.

"“The list of variables that shape climate […] would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.”","The basic argument in the remainder of the article is one of “complexity” and the notion that climatologists cannot perfectly understand thousands of variables, and hence the behavior of the system under investigation. Jacoby is not completely wrong—climate is extremely complex, and poses no shortage of interesting research questions. However, it is sometimes difficult for non-specialists to appreciate the emergent simplicity that can arise in an incredibly complex system. After all, how do we know summer will be warmer than winter, that the top of Mt. Everest is colder than the base, or that Arizona is expected to be on average drier than Florida, or that the equator ought to be hotter than New York, or that the climate will cool following a large volcanic eruption? These statements are not just based on prior observations, but in fact can be predicted by applying fundamental equations to a rotating planet. Part of the beauty in studying atmospheric science is in gaining an appreciation for where complexity is counterbalanced by an almost eerie predictability, much like how the outcome of a single spin in roulette is hopelessly unpredictable (and certainly influenced by every slight detail at the time the dealer releases the ball), but casinos have no problem with such complexity because the statistical behavior of the roulette wheel is well-posed. Similarly, the statistical behavior of the atmosphere, while unsolved, is not actually that complex. The appeal to complexity is a compelling one. Nonetheless, progress has been made in many complex sciences (astrophysics, geology) in which the system under investigation cannot be experimentally isolated, and yet where so much is known. However, it turns out to be incredibly simple to rule out El Niño, volcanic eruptions, soil quality, sunspot cycles, plate tectonics, etc. to the trend in global temperatures since 1950. Just as geologists can inform you of the glacial history of a region, sometimes with little more than a trained eye, CO2 leaves behind “fingerprints” in the atmospheric warming that other “forcing agents” do not. Another perhaps surprising component is that this result is not extremely sensitive to unknown variables. Suppose, for example, that the Andes Mountains were abruptly flattened. This would almost certainly affect important aspects of the global and regional climate, but many of the critical phenomena of the climate system (e.g. that the equator is wet where air rises, that storm tracks develop in the mid-latitudes, the presence of a jet stream, etc.) would still remain. Furthermore, adding CO2 to a “flat-Andes hypothetical Earth” would still result in warming. It’s physics, and it’s unavoidable. It is true that the exact magnitude of future warming, even if we knew future carbon emissions perfectly, is still not known to within even 10%. However, that uncertainty range does not overlap with “very little warming” or “make the planet uninhabitable warming.” In any case, if one’s argument is based on how complex the system is, surely perturbing that complex system is not something they ought to advocate for!",train,false authority,"TITLE: Climate is complex, but scientists have a good understanding of its variables

Water vapor cannot be a forcing because of its extremely short atmospheric lifetime in the troposphere. Adding a bunch of additional water vapor won’t cause long-term changes, at it will quickly precipitate out.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected a global sea level rise of 0.3 to 1.1 meters (1 to 3.6 feet) by 2100, depending on future greenhouse gas emissions.

MYTH: ""Because it’s getting warmer, there’s more CO2 coming out which means it’s going to get warmer which means there’s more CO2 coming out[…] And it will just run away with itself.""
FALLACY: This argument is based on the Feedback Loop Fallacy. While it is true that warming temperatures can cause more CO2 to be released from the oceans and other sources, this does not mean that the process will continue indefinitely.

"“[The West Antarctic Ice Sheet] is known to be losing ice rapidly because it is being melted from below by warm ocean waters, a process that is rendering its largest glaciers unstable.”","This is accurate but doesn’t fully explain that the warm ocean water is not a result of human-caused climate change and it is not a linear warming of Southern Ocean waters that causes melt beneath West Antarctic ice shelves. Rather, it is variability in the delivery of this relatively warm water (called Circumpolar Deep Water) that can directly affect how much melt is happening. Delivery of this water is altered by the direction and strength of winds over the Amundsen Sea, a subset of the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. If winds blow from west to east across the Amundsen Sea, they promote upwelling of this deep water under ice shelves, promoting melt and hence increasing ice loss*.

"“Ice core drilling shows that 800 years after natural warming, the atmosphere increases in carbon dioxide”","Recent work* shows that the temperature and CO2 rise were synchronous within uncertainties: if there was a lag it was less than 400 years, not 800 years as previously thought. Additionally, the temperature increase over the deglaciation cannot be explained solely by orbitally driven insolation changes (modifications of solar energy received by the Earth due to its position).

Parrenin et al (2013) Synchronous Change of Atmospheric CO2 and Antarctic Temperature During the Last Deglacial Warming, Science ",train,post hoc,"TITLE: The Natural Cycle of Carbon Dioxide and Temperature
FACT1: Carbon dioxide and temperature have a natural cycle that is linked. When the Earth warms, carbon dioxide is released from the oceans and other sources, which in turn amplifies the warming effect. When the Earth cools, carbon dioxide is absorbed by the oceans and other carbon sinks, which helps to cool the planet. 
MYTH: Ice core drilling shows that 800 years after natural warming, the atmosphere increases in carbon dioxide.
FALLACY: This myth is an example of a false choice fallacy, which presents two options as the only possibilities when other possibilities exist. It suggests that the increase in carbon dioxide is solely due to natural warming, ignoring the fact that human activities, such as burning fossil fuels, have significantly contributed to the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past century.

“More acidic oceans ‘will affect all sea life’”,“More acidic” is not entirely correct as the ocean is strictly speaking still alkaline (pH>7) and will remain so in the future. It is nevertheless true that the pH will most likely decrease (and has already done so in the past). A small change in the pH leads to large shifts in seawater carbonate chemistry (as the author correctly mentions later in the main text). The pH change will affect many species. I am not sure if the statement “all sea life” is justified at this stage. Indirect effects will likely play a major role here (as mentioned later in the text) but this still lacks evidence. This is more like “work in progress” I would say.,train,vagueness,"TITLE: The Impact of Acidic Oceans on Sea Life
FACT1: The acidity of the ocean is increasing due to the absorption of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This increase in acidity can have a significant impact on sea life, including the ability of organisms to build and maintain their shells and skeletons, as well as their overall survival and reproduction rates.

"“Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.”","People don’t like the cold, they like sunshine and warmth, and (supposedly as a result, according to Lomborg), they move to the South: does Lomborg really want us to deduce from that that global warming will thus be good for us – even simply in terms of temperature-related deaths? That’s not reasonable. First, while people have indeed generally been moving from the North(-East) to the South over the last decades, it’s not only because of “better climate”: quoting this article by the Washington Post, “Several long-term trends dating as far back as the 1960s are behind this larger pattern. The rise of air conditioning and interstate highways have made once-sleepy (and sweltering) Southern cities more appealing. And, over the same time, the decline of industrial jobs in the Midwest and Northeast have pushed people out. Cheap housing during the boom years also drove growth in states such as Arizona and Nevada“. I think that is already much more reasonable than saying that people move South only because they know they are less likely to die from cold exposure there. Second, people may be moving there right now partly because of climate, and that may indeed be a “smart” move because, TODAY, indeed, current cold-related deaths outnumber heat-related deaths. However, even supposing that this is a significant factor in their decision process, it’s not clear that they are also thinking about future warming. So the fact that people are moving there NOW does not even logically imply, as Lomborg would have it, that FUTURE warming will be beneficial – which is the point of interest here.",train,red herring,"TITLE: Migration patterns do not disprove global warming

Technically, this should include truly everything, including simply shutting down all manufacturing that uses fossil fuels at all. Banning the driving of any vehicle except electric vehicles run on renewables. Banning flying. I doubt that was the intent of the sentence. The same issue holds for “moving as quickly as they can.” What are the limits to”as quickly as they can”? Does it including shutting down the economy?

Unfortunately, on the timescale of centuries or decades, changes come too fast for the ocean’s natural processes to buffer ocean carbonate mineral saturation states. Directly comparing effects of high CO2 levels that developed in the geologic past over many millions of years with high CO2 levels developing today over decades and centuries shows a fundamental lack of understanding of well-established global geochemical cycles.

"“Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.”","The study referenced1 finds that, assuming some different possible scenarios for the speed of ice sheet processes and the IPCC’s highest emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), Antarctica alone can contribute anywhere from 0.5 to 4.5 feet (Figure 5b and d, below) of sea level rise. The DeConto & Pollard study1 does not include the potential for sea level rise from thermal expansion of sea water, melting of mountain glaciers or the Greenland Ice Sheet in it’s projections, but if these are included, the total sea level rise projected for 2100 may be something like 6 feet. If this is the calculation implicit in this statement that “…six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings”, than it is perhaps a bit misleading, since DeConto & Pollard is only focused on the contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. As DeConto & Pollard say in their study: “…the rates of ice loss simulated here should not be viewed as actual predictions, but rather as possible envelopes of behaviour”. Determining the “likely” amount of sea level rise in the future is a prediction that is strongly dependent on the assumptions about how ice sheet behave and on what time scales. Based on just DeConto & Pollard’s studies, and the assumptions inherent in their model, one can conclude that it is likely that sea level will rise by more than 11 feet, just from Antarctic melting, over the next several centuries, if humans do not significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (see Figure 5 and S7 of DeConto & Pollard 2016). What the glaciological community as a whole considers “likely” depends on which processes we think are likely to be important contributors of ice sheet collapse, which is a matter that is actively under debate. Since the DeConto & Pollard study is relatively new, there is still an ongoing discussion about how likely it is that the Marine Ice Cliff Instability will actually occur and at what rate will it causes ice to be lost from individual glaciers. Though the article as a whole covers some parts of this debate, these individual statements about likelihood do not necessarily reflect a community consensus.

"People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say, less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and, in many places, mildly beneficial.

It seems to imply that society has already decided to exactly double CO2 concentrations and has committed to emitting no further greenhouse gasses after that. If that were the case, then we could in fact assess climate change impacts in the manner done here. However, society is far from committing to stabilizing CO2 concentrations at “only” twice their preindustrial levels. We may go well beyond that.

"“In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.”","Most work on studying the dynamics of greenhouse gas balance in degrading permafrost systems, both as based on field measurements and as represented in ecosystem models for making climate feedback projections, seems to point to methane release being a relatively minor pathway for permafrost carbon to be released to the atmosphere, at least for terrestrial permafrost sources (which comprise most of the carbon mentioned here). It is true that terrestrial permafrost systems emit methane, but most of that methane is from recently photosynthesized carbon rather than older permafrost sources, and most of the carbon released from the older permafrost sources is released as either carbon dioxide or dissolved organic carbon rather than methane. So, while uncertainty on this issue remains high, and permafrost thaw is a potentially strong feedback process, this feedback seems likely to be dominated by carbon dioxide rather than methane. A specifically misleading thing about these numbers, which are a metric called “global warming potential”, is that their units are based on the mass of the gas. Since the question here is whether a given atom of carbon will be emitted to the atmosphere contained within either a molecule of carbon dioxide or a molecule of methane, you have to take into account the fact that the molecule of carbon dioxide is much heavier, because of the two oxygen atoms it picks up in the transformation to that gas, versus the four hydrogen atoms it would acquire in becoming methane. What this means in practice is that you have to divide the global warming potential by the ratio of the weight of the molecules, which is 44/16 or 2.75. So strictly speaking, the 34 and 86 ought to read 12 and 31.

“the adjusted data”,"It is surprising that, despite adjusted data being the crux of the arguments made here and in the study referred to, the author never explains why one may need to adjust measurements made on the ground or by satellites. There has been significant media coverage recently of some of the adjustments relating to temperature measurements made by satellites. Simply from a practical standpoint, it is beneficial to consider what is involved in sustaining the orbit of a satellite. Once put into orbit, a satellite will slowly “decay” away from its intended orbit as it is pulled nearer to Earth by gravity and other effects. Unless it has its own propulsion to correct for this, it will eventually be pulled out of orbit. This decay affects the exact time of day during which the satellite repeats measurements over one location. For example, from 1995 to 2005, the time of day that a NOAA satellite (NOAA-14) passed over the equator changed by more than 6 hours. The temperature in Quito at 12pm local time versus 6pm local time is quite different, so the satellite measurement must be corrected for this and other effects.

The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.,"Just to be clear, the main claim of climate science is that the global average temperature is increasing. The increase of heat waves is one of the many consequences of this. The article confusingly uses the term “record” in two meanings. The term records can be used for the observations that were recorded by meteorologists over the last centuries. The term “records” is mostly used for the highest or lowest value ever seen. In an article about the highest and lowest temperatures, it is best to avoid using the term records for the recorded data. The article also confusingly keeps on jumping between claims about local records in daily mean temperatures and claims about the long-term global mean temperature. Local temperatures are by their nature more variable than global average temperatures, daily temperatures are by their nature more variable than long-term average temperatures, records are by their nature more random than averages. With all the extra variability in the local daily records the authors can easily cherry pick a few data points that fit their narrative.

Which cloud effect ultimately wins out has to do with the optical thickness of the cloud (how reflective it is) and (as a rough approximation), the cloud height. As a quick rule: Higher clouds will act better as a blanket since they are both colder (and therefore radiate less energy to space) and typically optically thin. Conversely, lower clouds act more as a reflector since they are warmer and optically thick.

"“Before the end of this century, 80% of the world’s population would be wiped out.”","The late Stephen Schneider, one of the giants of modern climate science, once said that in his opinion “the ‘end of the world’ and ‘good for you’ are the two lowest probability outcomes” when discussing climate change. Lovelock seems to be swapping from one extreme largely unsupported by the bulk of existing scientific evidence to the opposite. In reality, our best evidence suggests that unmitigated climate change would be very detrimental to society (and the natural world), but that we can address it through difficult concerted action.

Rather, I refer to “publication bias”. In research, an “inherent bias” is one which is inextricably tied to the core nature of the phenomenon being studied and cannot, therefore, be eliminated by increasing the sample size or choosing a different estimator. “Publication bias”, on the other hand, refers to the general (across all of science) phenomenon by which studies presenting positive results – supporting the hypothesis being tested – are more likely to be published than those reporting negative results. This sometimes creates a situation where published studies may be systematically different from unpublished studies – for example, studies showing an impact of ocean acidification might be published more easily and in higher profile journals than studies showing no impact.

"CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener.","This may be true for certain regions in the mid-latitudes, but it presents a limited view of the Earth system. For regions experiencing drying, plant growth will be limited by the availability of water.

See for instance Wramneby et al (2010)1: “In the Scandinavian Mountains, reduced albedo resulting from the snow‐masking effect of forest expansion enhanced the winter warming trend. In central Europe, the stimulation of photosynthesis and plant growth by “CO2 fertilization” mitigated warming, through a negative evapotranspiration feedback associated with increased vegetation cover and leaf area index. In southern Europe, increased summer dryness restricted plant growth and survival, causing a positive warming feedback through reduced evapotranspiration.” (abstract) 1- Wramneby et al (2010) Hot spots of vegetation‐climate feedbacks under future greenhouse forcing in Europe, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres ",test,red herring,"TITLE: CO2's Role in the Climate System

FACT1: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in regulating the Earth's temperature. It traps heat in the atmosphere, which keeps the planet warm enough to support life. Without greenhouse gases like CO2, the Earth would be too cold to support life as we know it.

MYTH: CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener.

FALLACY: This myth is an oversimplification of the role of CO2 in the climate system. While it is true that CO2 is essential for plant growth and can contribute to greening the planet, it is also a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. The more CO2 there is in the atmosphere, the more heat it traps, leading to global warming and climate change.
