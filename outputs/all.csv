"there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events,","It’s not clear how you judge “systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather”. Since the 2013 UN IPCC report, we have new data and analysis showing increases in extreme heat and precipitation in many areas due to human-caused global warming. It is misleading not to mention this.",Dev,Cherry Picking,"Title: ""Extreme Weather and Climate Change""
Fact: Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, hurricanes, and droughts, have become more frequent and severe in recent decades due to the effects of climate change. 
Myth: Some people believe that there has been no systematic increase in the frequency of extreme weather events.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of cherry-picking, as it focuses on specific events or time periods in order to downplay the overall trend of increasing extreme weather. In reality, numerous studies have shown that extreme weather events have become more frequent and severe in recent decades, and that this trend is consistent with the effects of climate change.
Fact: The frequency and severity of extreme weather events have increased in recent decades due to the effects of climate change. This trend is supported by numerous studies and is a cause for concern for the well-being of people and the planet. Let's not spread misinformation about the relationship between extreme weather events and climate change."
"“Earlier this month, NASA scientists provided a visualization of a startling climate change trend — the Earth is getting greener, as viewed from space, especially in its rapidly warming northern regions. And this is presumably occurring as more carbon dioxide in the air, along with warmer temperatures and longer growing seasons, makes plants very, very happy.”","The point in the second sentence may be true for areas where longer growing seasons and warmer temperatures do increase productivity, but it is likely false for vast other regions of the world where lack of moisture will outweigh positive impacts of global change on growth. So this sentence right off the bat gives a bit of a misrepresentation by being worded in a way that can be construed as applying globally not just in the far north. Also there is nothing “startling” about this trend – it is exactly as hypothesized for such regions.",Train,Cherry Picking,"Title: ""NASA Visualization of Climate Change and Vegetation""
Fact: NASA scientists have provided a visualization of a climate change trend that shows the Earth is becoming greener, especially in the rapidly warming northern regions, as viewed from space. This trend is largely attributed to the presence of more carbon dioxide in the air, warmer temperatures, and longer growing seasons that are making plants thrive.
Myth: Some people believe that climate change is not affecting the Earth's vegetation in a positive way.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false analogy, as it incorrectly assumes that what may be true in one context is also true in another context. In reality, the fact that vegetation is becoming greener in some areas does not negate the negative impacts of climate change, such as rising temperatures, sea levels, and more frequent extreme weather events.
Fact: While it is true that the Earth is becoming greener in some areas due to climate change, this does not negate the negative impacts of climate change, nor does it mean that climate change is not a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Let's not spread misinformation about the complex impacts of climate change on the Earth's ecosystems."
"“If our climate conversation managed to include the good along with the bad, we would have a much better understanding of our options.”","True, but the author should set the example and have a balanced view here, showing the bad along with the good. Something he dramatically failed to do. ",Train,Cherry Picking,"Title: ""A Balanced Climate Conversation""
Fact: Climate change is a complex issue that involves both challenges and opportunities. While it is true that climate change poses significant risks to human societies and the natural world, addressing these risks can also create opportunities for innovation, economic growth, and community resilience.
Myth: Some people believe that the conversation about climate change only focuses on the negative impacts, and that this perspective hinders our understanding of potential solutions.
Fallacy: This myth is not based on a logical fallacy, but rather on a misunderstanding of the nature of the climate conversation. While it is true that there is often a focus on the negative impacts of climate change, this is because these impacts are significant and require urgent attention. However, there is also a growing recognition of the potential opportunities that can arise from addressing climate change.
Fact: A balanced climate conversation should include both the challenges and opportunities associated with climate change. By considering both the good and the bad, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the issue and develop effective solutions that address the risks while also creating opportunities for positive change. Let's work to ensure that our climate conversation is balanced and inclusive of all perspectives."
"“Ice cap is disappearing far more rapidly than previously estimated, and is part of a long-term trend, new research shows”","Again, “ice sheet” is more accurate than “ice cap”. In general, the term “ice cap” is not used in scientific literature. As a result, I think its use is confusing in the media, too, as people have a hard time understanding if it refers to ice sheets (thick ice on land) or sea ice (which are very different!).",Train,Vagueness,"Title: ""Disappearance of Ice Caps""
Fact: Recent research has shown that the disappearance of ice caps is occurring much more quickly than previously estimated. This is part of a long-term trend that has been observed over several decades.
Myth: There is a belief that the disappearance of ice caps is not a significant issue or is not occurring at an alarming rate.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of ignoring evidence, as there is a wealth of scientific research that shows that ice caps are disappearing at an alarming rate. Failing to acknowledge this evidence can lead to a misunderstanding of the severity of the issue and hinder efforts to address it.
Fact: The disappearance of ice caps is a significant issue that is occurring at an alarming rate. This has been demonstrated by numerous scientific studies and observations. It is important to acknowledge the evidence and take action to address the causes of this trend. Let's not spread misinformation about the issue of disappearing ice caps."
"More than 100 climate models over the past 30 years did not predict what actually happened because it was assumed carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation and the sun were trivial.","Rather than take Plimer’s word for this, a quick google of climate model predictions (and some evaluation of the quality of sources) will lead you to actual comparison of early climate model projections versus observations. Plimer’s statement is simply not true, climate model projections have been surprisingly accurate despite the simplicity of early computer models. As for the relative contribution of various factors to this warming, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are indeed much more important than other factors like clouds and the sun.

Fact: Climate models are computer simulations that are used to project future changes in the Earth's climate. These models take into account a wide range of factors that influence the Earth's climate, including changes in atmospheric composition, solar radiation, and the oceans. 
Myth: Some people believe that climate models have failed to predict changes in the Earth's climate because they assumed that carbon dioxide had the pivotal role in driving climate change and that the effects of clouds, back-radiation, and the sun were trivial.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of oversimplification, as it suggests that climate models only consider one factor (carbon dioxide) and ignore the importance of other factors. In reality, climate models take into account a wide range of factors that influence the Earth's climate, including changes in atmospheric composition, solar radiation, and the oceans. 
Fact: Climate models are complex and take into account a wide range of factors that influence the Earth's climate, including carbon dioxide, clouds, back-radiation, and the sun.

"“this event poses severe risks to health — particularly for children and the elderly […] an extreme 2003 heat wave that affected Paris and Europe, and which has indeed been connected to climate change through statistical attribution analysis […] killed hundreds of people in Paris and London, and a recent study attributed at least some of those deaths, themselves, to climate change.”",Only mentioning the deaths in two cities understates the danger of heat waves. The number of people who died in the 2003 heat wave is estimated to be in the tens of thousands.

Fact: Climate change can have significant impacts on human health, particularly for vulnerable populations such as children and the elderly. Heat waves, like the one that affected Paris and Europe in 2003, can be especially deadly, leading to hundreds of deaths and increased hospitalizations.
Myth: Some people believe that the connection between climate change and health risks is not clear or well-established.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of ignoring evidence, as there is a large body of research that has established the link between climate change and health risks, including the risks posed by extreme heat. Statistical attribution analysis has linked the 2003 heat wave in Paris and Europe to climate change, and recent studies have shown that climate change has contributed to heat-related deaths in cities around the world.

"The Rio Grande is a classic “feast or famine” river, with a dry year or two typically followed by a couple of wet years that allow for recovery.",Weird wording. It’s just an arid river with high inter-annual variability in precipitation and flows.,Train,Vagueness,"Title: ""The Rio Grande's Cyclic Nature""
Fact: The Rio Grande is a river that runs through the southwestern United States and is known for its cyclic nature. It typically experiences periods of drought followed by periods of heavy rainfall, resulting in a ""feast or famine"" cycle.
Myth: Some people believe that the Rio Grande's cyclic nature is abnormal or caused by human influence.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false cause, as it suggests that the cyclic nature of the Rio Grande is caused by human influence or abnormal factors. In reality, the cyclic nature of the Rio Grande is a natural phenomenon that has been observed for centuries.
Fact: The Rio Grande's cyclic nature is a natural phenomenon that has been observed for centuries.

"on average, the projected heating by the models is three times what has been observed.","As suggested in the last comment this statistic is quite uncertain (1.5 – 3.3). Some climate models simulate less warming than some satellite datasets. The reason that the average of the CMIP5 models exhibits more warming than observations is in part due to natural variability and problems with the forcing (aerosols, solar changes, etc.) in the models.",Test,False Authority,"Title: ""Climate Models and Observations""
Fact: Climate models are computer simulations that are used to project how the Earth's climate will change over time based on various factors such as greenhouse gas emissions and changes in solar radiation. These models are based on a large body of scientific research and are continually updated and refined as new data becomes available.
Myth: Some people believe that the projected heating by climate models is three times what has been observed.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of cherry picking, as it selectively presents only part of the story. While it is true that some studies have found discrepancies between climate model projections and observed temperatures, these studies often focus on short-term variations rather than long-term trends. In addition, many factors can influence short-term temperature variations, such as volcanic eruptions and changes in solar radiation, which are not always accounted for in these studies.
Fact: Climate models and observations are complex, and it is not accurate to simply compare the two and draw conclusions about their accuracy. While there may be some discrepancies between model projections and observed temperatures in the short-term, the long-term trends and patterns are consistent with the predictions of climate models.

“That is especially bad because the Amazon alone provides 20 percent of our oxygen.”,"This sentence somehow implies that deforesting the Amazon would reduce atmospheric oxygen by 20%. This is not true. To quote Wally Broecker, who is cited later in the article: “Simply put, our atmosphere is endowed with such an enormous reserve of this gas that even if we were to burn all our fossil fuel reserves, all our trees, and all the organic matter stored in soils, we would use up only a few percent of the available O2. No matter how foolishly we treat our environmental heritage, we simply don’t have the capacity to put more than a small dent in our O2 supply. Furthermore, the Earth’s forests do not play a dominant role in maintaining O2 reserves, because they consume just as much of this gas as they produce. In the tropics, ants, termites, bacteria, and fungi eat nearly the entire photosynthetic O2 product. Only a tiny fraction of the organic matter they produce accumulates in swamps and soils or is carried down the rivers for burial on the sea floor.”",Train,No Fallacy,"Title: ""The Amazon and Oxygen Supply""
Fact: The Amazon rainforest is the largest tropical rainforest in the world, covering about 40% of South America. It is known for its rich biodiversity and plays an important role in regulating the Earth's climate. However, it is not the primary source of oxygen for the planet.
Myth: Some people believe that the Amazon rainforest alone provides 20% of the Earth's oxygen supply.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false statement, as it suggests that the Amazon is the primary source of oxygen for the planet. In reality, the Earth's oxygen supply is primarily produced by ocean phytoplankton through photosynthesis, though terrestrial vegetation also plays a role.

Fact: Extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, can have negative impacts on human health. In the United States, heat-related deaths are estimated to be around 9,000 per year, while cold-related deaths are estimated to be around 144,000 per year.
Myth: Some people believe that because more people die from cold than from heat, heat-related deaths are not a significant concern.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false equivalence, as it incorrectly assumes that because more people die from cold than from heat, heat-related deaths are not a significant concern. In reality, both heat and cold can have negative impacts on human health and are important to consider in public health and climate policy.
Fact: While it is true that more people die from cold than from heat in the United States, heat-related deaths are still a significant concern that should not be ignored.

can today’s climate models be trusted when scientists have misrepresented the data in the past?,"A strangely (deliberately?) vague swipe at climate science. The author presents no evidence that scientists have intentionally misrepresented “the data” in the past, or which data this refers to (either here, or later in the article). ",Train,Evading the Burden of Proof,"This question presents a common myth about climate science and the trustworthiness of climate models. While it is true that some scientists have misrepresented data in the past, this does not automatically mean that today's climate models cannot be trusted.

In reality, climate models are based on a vast amount of data and research, and are subject to rigorous testing and evaluation before they are used to make predictions about the future of the Earth's climate. While there is always some degree of uncertainty associated with any scientific model, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists agree that climate models are a reliable tool for understanding the Earth's climate and predicting future changes.

It is important to recognize that the actions of a few individuals do not reflect the integrity or accuracy of an entire field of science. While it is always important to remain skeptical and critical of scientific research, it is equally important to recognize the vast amount of evidence and research that supports the consensus view on climate change."
"“Entire states and nations have to decide to clean up their energy systems, using every tool available and moving as quickly as they can.”","“Using every tool available” is highly debatable, as even tools which are usually perceived to help mitigating climate (e.g. reforestation), may not result in mitigation effects, depending on how they are implemented. A study on European forests* has shown that afforestation since 1750 was responsible for an increase of 0.12 watts per square meter in the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere, rather than a decrease, because of management choices.

Fact: Many states and nations have recognized the urgent need to transition to clean energy in order to address the causes and impacts of climate change. This transition involves using a variety of tools and approaches, such as investing in renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Myth: Some people believe that transitioning to clean energy is too difficult or not worth the effort.
Fact: Transitioning to clean energy is necessary in order to address the causes and impacts of climate change, which pose significant risks to people and the planet. While it may be challenging to make this transition, the costs of inaction are much greater.

The increase will not be uniform—exacerbating the consequences described below,Train,Vagueness,"Title: ""The Impacts of Sea Level Rise""
Fact: Sea level rise is a consequence of global warming, which is caused by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. As temperatures rise, glaciers and ice sheets melt, and the oceans expand, leading to an overall increase in sea level.

"In the past, the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been orders of magnitude higher than now, yet there were ice ages","This is a very bold (and wrong) statement. In the past 2 million years, CO2 has been lower than today and there were ice ages (glacials) when CO2 fell below a certain threshold. If we look further back, e.g. tens of millions of years, to periods of time when CO2 was higher than today (as in the Eocene), there was not much ice or snow around (if any)—certainly no ice age. If we go hundreds of millions of years back, the Sun was less strong than today. So yes, there might have been ice with higher CO2 concentrations and a faint Sun, but who knows? CO2 reconstructions do not go that far back.",Train,No Fallacy,"Title: ""Past Climate and Carbon Dioxide""
Fact: Throughout Earth's history, there have been periods of both warming and cooling, with corresponding changes in the atmospheric carbon dioxide content. However, the relationship between carbon dioxide and climate is complex and depends on a variety of factors, including changes in the Earth's orbit, solar radiation, and ocean currents.
Myth: Some people believe that because the atmospheric carbon dioxide content has been higher in the past and there were still ice ages, carbon dioxide cannot be responsible for current climate change.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the false equivalence fallacy, as it assumes that because carbon dioxide has not always been the sole driver of climate change in the past, it cannot be responsible for current changes. In reality, the current increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide is primarily due to human activity, and the current warming trend is consistent with the scientific understanding of the greenhouse effect.
Fact: The fact that there have been ice ages in the past despite higher atmospheric carbon dioxide content does not negate the role of carbon dioxide in current climate change.

"“In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.”","The author’s facts about methane are generally accurate, but he amps up concern about catastrophic release of methane from permafrost beyond what evidence supports. Scientists also investigate whether methane frozen at the seafloor of some continental shelves can be catastrophically be released to the atmosphere. However, existing evidence suggests that natural processes prevent catastrophe. Marine methane (gas hydrates) are heavily processed in the water column, and no contribution to the atmosphere has yet been observed.

"“First, marine species that calcify have survived through millions of years when CO2 was at much higher levels; second, they are more than capable of adapting — even in the short term — to environmental change”","Many marine organisms respond to changes in calcium carbonate mineral saturation states. These depend not only on pH, but also on factors including amounts of carbon and calcium in the ocean. One of the most important factors is ocean alkalinity, which varies on time scale of many thousands of years. In the geologic past, when atmospheric CO2 was high, ocean alkalinity was also high, and so carbonate mineral saturation states could remain high. Unfortunately, on the timescale of centuries or decades, changes come too fast for the ocean’s natural processes to buffer ocean carbonate mineral saturation states. Directly comparing effects of high CO2 levels that developed in the geologic past over many millions of years with high CO2 levels developing today over decades and centuries shows a fundamental lack of understanding of well-established global geochemical cycles.

"“The problem with this ploy is that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant and it is dishonest to say it is. CO2 is colorless, odorless and completely non-toxic. Plants depend on it to live and grow, and human beings draw some into their lungs with every breath they take to no ill effect whatsoever. Growers regularly pump CO2 into greenhouses, raising levels to three times that of the natural environment, to produce stronger, greener, healthier plants.”","This statement is absolutely ridiculous. It violates the most basic, fundamental maxim of toxicology, first articulated by the Renaissance physician Paracelsus: “The dose makes the poison.” Or, “All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison.” In other words, just because a substance at one concentration is harmless does not mean it is harmless at another concentration. We don’t normally think of consumption of water as harmful to humans, but at high enough doses it will kill—and has done so. A pollutant is generally defined as a substance—artificial (synthetic) or natural—that occurs in the environment at least in part because of human activity, and that has a deleterious impact on living systems. Given that basic definition, there is no way that CO2 can not be a pollutant. It is produced by a variety of human activities, but principally burning of fossil fuels. Increases in its concentration are clearly linked to global warming, which has already, and increasingly will, negatively affect living systems, including humans. The only exit from this logic is to deny that CO2 leads to warming (in contradiction to massive scientific evidence) or to deny that warming negatively impacts living systems (again in contradiction to massive evidence). The authors use a classic rhetorical ploy to confound bits of information and draw erroneous conclusions. Yes, at low concentrations CO2 is not directly harmful to humans, and in fact is required by plants. And yes, small increases in CO2 have been shown to increase plant growth. (Some of my own work has shown such; such increases also shift the chemical composition of plant tissues, and not always for the better!). Plants grown under elevated CO2 do grow faster. To my knowledge, there is no evidence that they are “stronger” (whatever that means), and if anything, they are less green. Nor is there convincing evidence they are healthier. If anything, insects consume them more than ambient-CO2 plants.",Train,Red Herring,"Title: ""The Truth About Carbon Dioxide""

"“The list of variables that shape climate […] would run to hundreds, if not thousands, of elements, none of which scientists would claim to understand with absolute precision.”","The basic argument in the remainder of the article is one of “complexity” and the notion that climatologists cannot perfectly understand thousands of variables, and hence the behavior of the system under investigation. Jacoby is not completely wrong—climate is extremely complex, and poses no shortage of interesting research questions. However, it is sometimes difficult for non-specialists to appreciate the emergent simplicity that can arise in an incredibly complex system. After all, how do we know summer will be warmer than winter, that the top of Mt. Everest is colder than the base, or that Arizona is expected to be on average drier than Florida, or that the equator ought to be hotter than New York, or that the climate will cool following a large volcanic eruption? These statements are not just based on prior observations, but in fact can be predicted by applying fundamental equations to a rotating planet. Part of the beauty in studying atmospheric science is in gaining an appreciation for where complexity is counterbalanced by an almost eerie predictability, much like how the outcome of a single spin in roulette is hopelessly unpredictable (and certainly influenced by every slight detail at the time the dealer releases the ball), but casinos have no problem with such complexity because the statistical behavior of the roulette wheel is well-posed. Similarly, the statistical behavior of the atmosphere, while unsolved, is not actually that complex. The appeal to complexity is a compelling one. Nonetheless, progress has been made in many complex sciences (astrophysics, geology) in which the system under investigation cannot be experimentally isolated, and yet where so much is known. However, it turns out to be incredibly simple to rule out El Niño, volcanic eruptions, soil quality, sunspot cycles, plate tectonics, etc. to the trend in global temperatures since 1950. Just as geologists can inform you of the glacial history of a region, sometimes with little more than a trained eye, CO2 leaves behind “fingerprints” in the atmospheric warming that other “forcing agents” do not. Another perhaps surprising component is that this result is not extremely sensitive to unknown variables. Suppose, for example, that the Andes Mountains were abruptly flattened. This would almost certainly affect important aspects of the global and regional climate, but many of the critical phenomena of the climate system (e.g. that the equator is wet where air rises, that storm tracks develop in the mid-latitudes, the presence of a jet stream, etc.) would still remain. Furthermore, adding CO2 to a “flat-Andes hypothetical Earth” would still result in warming. It’s physics, and it’s unavoidable. It is true that the exact magnitude of future warming, even if we knew future carbon emissions perfectly, is still not known to within even 10%. However, that uncertainty range does not overlap with “very little warming” or “make the planet uninhabitable warming.” In any case, if one’s argument is based on how complex the system is, surely perturbing that complex system is not something they ought to advocate for!",Train,False Authority,"Title: ""The Complexity of Climate Science""

“Whether Antarctic mass loss keeps worsening depends on choices made today”,"This is the biggest opportunity to add more depth to the analysis of this new Antarctic ice loss result. An important point here is that the human fingerprint on this Antarctic mass loss is still hard to identify. A 2013 assessment1 showed that expert opinion is “uncertain and undecided” about whether recent ice sheet behavior simply reflects natural variability or is a response to human-caused climate change. This is essentially because our observations of ice sheet behavior are too short, 30 years at best for satellite observations of the ice sheet. This just meets the minimum definition of a “climatology” with respect to the atmosphere, and we know that the ice sheet operates on longer timescales than the atmosphere (it is a big system to move!). Although West Antarctica has been one of the fastest-warming places on the planet over the last 60 years (sparse weather records begin in 1957), as Steig et al showed in 20092 and Bromwich et al confirmed in 20133, how/whether this atmospheric warming has emerged from natural climate variability is less clear. It is also unclear how this warming trend will continue, as climate in West Antarctica is pushed around by Pacific Ocean-atmosphere variability. From ice core records we (myself and MANY others) have drilled and analyzed across this region we do not see recent anomalies exceeding variability over the last 2000 years4. From measurements of ice borehole temperatures in the same region, the ice itself directly records anomalous warmth over the last 50 years5. Antarctic weather is known to be harsh but it is also some of the most variable on the planet. The human fingerprint of atmospheric warming has emerged everywhere else on the planet as early as about 200 years ago, but we are still waiting for it to clearly emerge in Antarctica (see Figure 2 in Abram et al, 20166). As Mooney explains, how much atmospheric warming comes to Antarctica largely depends on our carbon emission choices in the near-term. In addition to all of this, the ice loss in West Antarctica is less driven by ocean warming as it is by increased delivery of relatively-warm deep ocean currents beneath ice shelves. This delivery is driven by the atmosphere; whether winds blow strong enough in the right direction to drive upwelling currents beneath Pacific-facing West Antarctic ice shelves. Decadal-scale variability of the Pacific Ocean-atmosphere system in turn affect the strength and position of these current-driving winds. Summary: it’s very complicated but the Pacific Ocean is the beast to watch for future West Antarctic ice loss, in combination with the dynamics of Pine Island, Thwaites, and a few smaller glaciers (Smith, Kohler) along the Amundsen Sea coast of West Antarctica. 1-Bamber and Aspinall (2013) An expert judgement assessment of future sea level rise from the ice sheets, Nature Climate Change 2-Steig et al (2019) Warming of the Antarctic ice-sheet surface since the 1957 International Geophysical Year, Nature 3-Bromwich et al (2013) Central West Antarctica among the most rapidly warming regions on Earth, Nature Geoscience 4-Steig et al (2013) Recent climate and ice-sheet changes in West Antarctica compared with the past 2,000 years, Nature Geoscience 5-Orsi et al (2012) Little Ice Age cold interval in West Antarctica: Evidence from borehole temperature at the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Divide, Geophysical Research Letters 6-Abram et al (2016) Early onset of industrial-era warming across the oceans and continents, Nature ",Test,Cherry Picking,"Title: ""Antarctic Mass Loss and Future Choices""

Some climate models do actually have volcanoes of various sizes stuck in randomly in the future (since we can’t really predict future volcanism apart from assuming it occurs at roughly the same rate as we’ve experienced in the past), but the inclusion of these don’t really change the expected warming or other climate impacts in the next century. Hansen et al (1996) A Pinatubo Climate Modeling Investigation  ",Test,Red Herring,"Title: ""Volcanoes and Climate Change""
Fact: Volcanic eruptions can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate by releasing large amounts of gases and particles into the atmosphere. These gases and particles can reflect sunlight and cool the Earth's surface, leading to a temporary cooling effect on the climate.
Myth: Some people believe that a single sizable volcano eruption can render all climate models and other evidence about climate change irrelevant.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of an anecdote, as it relies on a single example to make a generalization about climate change. In reality, climate change is influenced by a complex array of factors, including changes in atmospheric composition, temperature, and other factors, and cannot be explained by a single event such as a volcanic eruption.
Fact: While volcanic eruptions can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate, they cannot fully explain the long-term trends of climate change that are observed in the scientific evidence.

"CO2 is not powerful in that sense, the only thing it does in the system is make the planet greener.","This may be true for certain regions in the mid-latitudes, but it presents a limited view of the Earth system. For regions experiencing drying, plant growth will be limited by the availability of water. Reafforestation at high latitudes (due to a combination of warming and less grazing) changes the albedo, which feeds back to warming the local climate. See for instance Wramneby et al (2010)1: “In the Scandinavian Mountains, reduced albedo resulting from the snow‐masking effect of forest expansion enhanced the winter warming trend. In central Europe, the stimulation of photosynthesis and plant growth by “CO2 fertilization” mitigated warming, through a negative evapotranspiration feedback associated with increased vegetation cover and leaf area index. In southern Europe, increased summer dryness restricted plant growth and survival, causing a positive warming feedback through reduced evapotranspiration.” (abstract) 1- Wramneby et al (2010) Hot spots of vegetation‐climate feedbacks under future greenhouse forcing in Europe, Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres ",Test,Red Herring,"I'm sorry, but that statement is not accurate.

"“But recent examples from other regions, like the rapidly collapsing Larsen B ice shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula, show that once ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers start to flow faster toward the sea, an effect that can weaken the stability of ice further inland, too.”","Regarding ice shelf stability, it is important to acknowledge (which the author didn’t do here) there are different processes at work on the Antarctic Peninsula, where the Larsen ice shelves reside(d), than on the Amundsen coast (Pine Island and Thwaites ice shelves). The Larsen A and B ice shelves were very thin, and have disintegrated from percolating surface meltwater (hydrofracturing) creating vertical cracks in the ice shelf. Larsen C is thicker and larger, but is also characterised by a relatively warm climate (many melt episodes in summer) and low snowfall (which makes it vulnerable to atmospheric warming). The ice shelves that buttress the Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers are much thicker, annual snowfall rates are very large, and surface melt rates are substantially lower than on the (former) Larsen ice shelves (3-5 times lower). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that surface-based ice shelf instability will occur within the next few decades—instead, these ice shelves would likely thin through contact with warmer oc",Dev,Post Hoc,"Title: ""The Connection Between Ice Shelves and Glacial Stability""
Fact: Ice shelves are floating extensions of glaciers that play a significant role in maintaining the stability of glaciers and preventing them from flowing into the ocean. When ice shelves break apart as a result of warming, their parent glaciers can start to flow faster toward the sea, which can weaken the stability of the ice further inland.
Myth: Some people believe that the collapse of ice shelves has little impact on the stability of glaciers and the overall ice sheet.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of oversimplification, as it suggests that the loss of ice shelves has little impact on the stability of the overall ice sheet. In reality, the collapse of ice shelves can have a significant impact on the stability of glaciers and the overall ice sheet, as it can cause glaciers to flow faster and contribute more to sea level rise.

Therefore, people living in low-lying areas, even if there is historical land area gain, are still susceptible to inundation and damages due to storm waves, higher-than-usual tides (e.g. king tides), and sea level rise. These unconsolidated, loose sediments are also easily mobilized; therefore, localized land area gains by sediment accretion can be very dynamic on short timescales.

Fact: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in the Earth's climate system. When CO2 is released into the atmosphere, it traps heat and warms the Earth's surface, leading to climate change. Instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years show that the Earth's temperature has been steadily increasing, with the warmest years on record occurring in recent decades.
Myth: Some people believe that there is no correlation between human emissions of CO2 and temperature based on instrumental temperature measurements over the past 150 years.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of cherry picking, as it selectively presents only a narrow slice of the data in order to draw a misleading conclusion. In reality, there is a strong scientific consensus that human emissions of CO2 are contributing to climate change, based on a wide range of evidence including temperature measurements, ice core records, and computer models of the Earth's climate system.

Fact: Sea level rise is a well-documented phenomenon that has been ongoing since the end of the last ice age. The current rate of sea level rise is estimated to be around 3.3 millimeters per year, and this rate has been increasing in recent decades due to the warming of the Earth's climate.
Myth: Some people believe that the ongoing rise in sea level is not increasing in magnitude and is not a cause for concern.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of ambiguity, as it uses ambiguous language to lead to a misleading conclusion. In reality, while the rate of sea level rise may not be increasing dramatically, it is still a cause for concern because it can have significant impacts on coastal communities and ecosystems. Even a small increase in sea level can lead to more frequent and severe flooding, erosion of coastlines, and loss of habitat.
Fact: The ongoing rise in sea level is a cause for concern, even if the magnitude of the increase is not currently dramatic.

“The warming will slow to a potentially manageable pace only when human emissions are reduced to zero.”,"he current understanding of interactions between the global carbon cycle and the climate system is that when global CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, the warming will remain approximately constant. This is very often confused by estimates of committed “warming in the pipeline” which instead of assuming that global emissions are reduced to zero, assume that concentrations (and therewith to a large degree forcing) are kept constant. Keeping CO2 concentrations constant would require continuous emissions of CO2 that perfectly counter the uptake by natural sinks. If CO2 emissions are reduced to zero, atmospheric CO2 concentrations will gradually decline. For heat-trapping emissions other than CO2, the requirement to reduce them to zero to stabilize warming depends on their residence time in the atmosphere. For gases and particles that only stay in the atmosphere for shorter time periods (days to a decade) achieving constant emissions would also achieve approximately stabilized warming.",Train,Vagueness,"Title: ""The Relationship Between Emissions and Climate Change""
Fact: Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which contribute to climate change. The more greenhouse gases are emitted, the more the Earth's climate will warm.
Myth: Some people believe that the warming will only slow to a manageable pace when human emissions are reduced to zero.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of oversimplification, as it suggests that reducing emissions to zero is the only solution to managing the pace of warming. In reality, there are many ways to address climate change, including reducing emissions, developing renewable energy sources, and increasing energy efficiency.
Fact: While reducing emissions is an important step in addressing climate change, it is not the only solution. There are many different ways to address climate change and manage the pace of warming, and reducing emissions to zero may not be feasible or practical in the short term.

But projections are very clear, and the fact that we cannot detect the links in all observations YET does not mean that it will not emerge when the warming signal increases.

Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false analogy, as it suggests that the current warming trend is just a natural occurrence like the PETM. In reality, the current warming trend is largely driven by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which are releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Fact: The jet stream is a powerful wind that circles the Earth in the upper atmosphere, separating cold air in the Arctic from warmer air in the tropics. The temperature difference between the Arctic and the equator influences the strength and position of the jet stream.
Myth: Some people believe that the jet stream's flow is not affected by Arctic warming.
Fallacy: This myth is based on a misunderstanding of the relationship between Arctic warming and the jet stream.

“The Greenland ice cap last winter increased in volume faster than at any time for years.”,"This is not per se completely incorrect, but the author does not tell us the whole story. The author refers to the growing of the ice sheet volume through snowfall throughout winter. The snow accumulated on Greenland in past winter (September-April) has indeed been remarkably high: However, this does not imply that the volume of the ice sheet is increasing, because (1) the ice sheet also loses ice through discharging icebergs; it is the difference between snowfall-driven growth and solid ice discharge that determines if the ice sheet gains or loses volume, and (2) the snow that accumulated during the winter will (at least partly) melt over the summer. That’s why we analyse changes to the ice sheet volume/mass on (at least) annual time scales. Only after the summer we will know how much of the accumulated snow has (not) been melted. uring the past years, the amount of melting has been record-high, and much of snow that accumulated over the winter melted and ran off into the ocean. Concurrently, ice discharge continued, so the Greenland ice sheet LOST considerable volume. We will know in September how much the ice sheet has changed volume this year. Two additional remarks: (a) The word “faster” should not have been used here. We are not talking about the rate of speed, but rather about the total change in volume. Also, it is easier to talk about “mass changes” than “volume changes” since the former is not sensitive to the density of the medium we are talking about (snow has a lower density than ice!). (b) The enhanced snowfall, ironically, is most probably also a signal of the strongly warming Arctic: as the atmosphere warms, it contains more moisture, and generates more precipitation.

But remember for the northern hemisphere, for North America, the fact that the location in West Antarctica is where the action is amplifies that rate of sea level rise by up to an about additional 25 percent in a city like Boston or New York.’ That’s because as Antarctica’s mass shrinks, the ice sheet’s gravitational pull on the ocean relaxes somewhat, and the seas travel back across the globe to pile up far away — with U.S. coasts being one prime destination.”","This effect is called the gravitational effect, and it is the consequence of one of the basic laws of physics: mass attracts mass. When mass is lost on Antarctica, sea level will fall within a 2,200 km radius due to the loss of gravitational pull. Between 2,200 and 7,600 km, sea level will rise but less than the global average. Beyond 7,600 km, sea level rise will be larger than the global mean, up to 25% extra.

Fact: Heat waves can increase the risk of wildfires by creating dry and hot conditions that are conducive to the ignition and spread of fires. In particular, high temperatures can cause vegetation to dry out, making it more flammable and increasing the likelihood of fires.
Myth: Some people believe that the wet Western winter should have reduced the risk of wildfires in the summer.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of oversimplification, as it assumes that the wet Western winter should have completely eliminated the risk of wildfires in the summer. In reality, the risk of wildfires is influenced by a complex array of factors, including temperature, humidity, wind, and fuel moisture. Even in areas that received above-average precipitation, high temperatures and dry conditions can increase the risk of wildfires.
Fact: The relationship between weather patterns and the risk of wildfires is complex, and cannot be reduced to a simple cause-and-effect relationship. While wet conditions can reduce the risk of wildfires in some cases, high temperatures and dry conditions can increase the risk even in areas that received above-average precipitation.

"“The Lancet researchers found that about 0.5%—half a percent—of all deaths are associated with heat, not only from acute problems like heat stroke, but also increased mortality from cardiac events and dehydration. But more than 7% of deaths are related to cold—counting hypothermia, as well as increased blood pressure and risk of heart attack that results when the body restricts blood flow in response to frigid temperatures.”","I do not want to question the quality of this particular study, but it’s worth looking at how they get such numbers. First, this is a statistical study where they look at data on numbers of deaths and temperatures in various locations: of course, nothing says if, or how, these deaths are really related to temperature (heat or cold). This is an empirical study. Lomborg’s comments suggest that the authors of this study are counting deaths explicitly caused by heat or cold, but this is not the case. Second, they basically fit a temperature-death risk response curve to this data. They then see for what temperature the mortality risk is lowest – and then they aggregate all the deaths below (for cold-related deaths) and above (for heat-related ones) that temperature. Because the temperature of minimum mortality is often high (around 20-25C, or lower 70’s F), for cold-related deaths this leads to integrating the response function (even with low death risks) over much of the temperature distribution. See plots below. The authors indicate as much: “This difference was mainly caused by the high minimum-mortality percentile, with most of the mean daily temperatures being lower than the optimum value.” This methodology also explains why most cold-related deaths appear due to “moderate cold”. This is worth explaining, because I am not sure dying in 15C weather (60F) in Rome or Sydney is really what people will understand when they read about “cold-related deaths”! From Gasparrini et al. figure 1: Exposure–response associations as best linear unbiased prediction (with 95% empirical CI, shaded grey) in representative cities of the 13 countries, with related temperature distributions. Solid grey lines are minimum mortality temperatures and dashed grey lines are the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. RR=relative risk. The other thing that is easy to see is that the risk curve generally increases slowly towards cold temperature, but a lot more steeply past high temperatures. So even if one agrees with how this study classifies and counts “cold deaths”, the fact that they outnumber heat deaths, in absolute numbers, does not necessarily mean that increasing temperatures will reduce deaths: based on these plots, it could well be that warming will reduce cold-related deaths less than it increases heat-related ones. And indeed, this is what the studies about future projection of temperature-related deaths that they cite, and that Lomborg discusses, do find.

However, it’s generally considered to be a fraction of those. We know better future effects because we have CO2 fertilization experiments in the field comparing present to future CO2 levels. Those experiments suggest that corn may have about a 1% gain [because of increased CO2] and soybeans 3-4 times that. However, these gains will almost certainly be offset by yield declines associated with the temperature increases caused by elevated CO2, which are well known. Historically, it’s worth noting that we had elevated CO2 long before we had the green revolution, and crop yields didn’t increase much until the green revolution.

“the adjusted data”,"It is surprising that, despite adjusted data being the crux of the arguments made here and in the study referred to, the author never explains why one may need to adjust measurements made on the ground or by satellites. There has been significant media coverage recently of some of the adjustments relating to temperature measurements made by satellites. Simply from a practical standpoint, it is beneficial to consider what is involved in sustaining the orbit of a satellite. Once put into orbit, a satellite will slowly “decay” away from its intended orbit as it is pulled nearer to Earth by gravity and other effects. Unless it has its own propulsion to correct for this, it will eventually be pulled out of orbit. This decay affects the exact time of day during which the satellite repeats measurements over one location. For example, from 1995 to 2005, the time of day that a NOAA satellite (NOAA-14) passed over the equator changed by more than 6 hours. The temperature in Quito at 12pm local time versus 6pm local time is quite different, so the satellite measurement must be corrected for this and other effects.

“Ice-free means the central basin of the Arctic will be ice-free and I think that that is going to happen in summer 2017 or 2018.”,"It is not clear whether a permanent or a one-year phenomenon is meant here (probably the former), but in any case the scientific support for the claim is weak. In the former case (permanent disappearance), this would not correspond to what most sea ice experts do consider. Indeed, section 11.3.4.1 of the last (2013) IPCC assessment report suggests a very low probability for permanent disappearance within the current decade. In fact, from the scientific literature it seems the phenomenon is more likely to take place during the period 2040-2060. Of course, a very low probability does not necessarily mean a zero probability, and IPCC’s report could possibly underestimate the odds for disappearance within the next few years. But before propagating a marginal view (relative to IPCC conclusions), one should ensure having a very strong argumentation; in this interview no argumentation is put forward to support Peter Wadhams’ central claim. In the other possible case (isolated single-year disappearance), it has to be said sea ice has strong year-to-year variability superimposed on its long-term declining trend, and no one has the tools to precisely predict the outcome one year in advance. Seasonal-to-decadal prediction groups equipped with physically-based models have some potential prediction skill for lead times up to 12-24 months, but they currently cannot guarantee to be right for any specific forecast (e.g.: Seasonal Forecasts of the Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Extent Using a GCM-Based Seasonal Prediction System and Pan-Arctic and Regional Sea Ice Predictability: Initialization Month Dependence).

"Already, scientists know enough to be concerned. About 120,000 years ago, before the last ice age, the planet went through a natural warm period, with temperatures similar to those expected in coming decades.

Indeed, past climate states analogous to the state which is expected to manifest in the near future, are characterized by much higher sea levels. This implies that the current Antarctic (and Greenland) ice sheet volumes are not consistent with warmer climate states.

Fact: About 120,000 years ago, the Earth went through a natural warm period that lasted for several thousand years. During this period, temperatures were similar to those expected in the coming decades due to human-caused climate change. The sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than it is today, indicating that the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica must have partly disintegrated.

Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of false equivalence, as it suggests that natural climate change in the past is equivalent to human-caused climate change today. In reality, the current warming of the planet is caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, and is occurring at a much faster rate than natural climate change in the past.
Fact: The natural warm period that occurred about 120,000 years ago provides a warning of what could occur in the future if the heating of the planet continues unchecked.

"“In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon.”","It depends on the type of event. heatwaves and extreme heat events have increased since at least the 1950s1. Though tropical cyclones and drought are a bit harder to analyse since natural climate variability also plays a large role. This means there may be a signal of change due to human activity, but is more difficult to measure, due to the noise of the natural variability of the climate. Also, “attribution” can be done for specific events. this basically compares how often an extreme event of a particular magnitude and duration occurs in climate model simulations both with and without human emissions of greenhouse gases. This was first done on the 2003 European heatwave2. So it can be done, but is heavily dependent to the event you analyse, the spacial scale on which it occurs, and even the climate model/s and experimental set up you use3 1- Perkins (2012) Increasing frequency, intensity and duration of observed global heatwaves and warm spells.

"“there are alarming stories every day, like last month’s satellite data showing the globe warming, since 1998, more than twice as fast as scientists had thought”","This sentence is true for RSS data, but it’s somewhat misleading due to lack of context. If you look at the two most recent versions of the RSS data and compute linear trends Jan 1998-Dec 2016, you find that the new version has a trend value for this period of about 2.6 times larger than the previous version. But, it is good to remember that 1998 is a favorite starting point for those that seek to minimize the perceived threat of global warming. This preference is because 1998 is a relative maximum in global temperature (due to a large ENSO event), and thus trends that start in Jan 1998 are smaller than trends that start in other, nearby years. This means that when the change in trends between datasets is reported as a multiplicative effect, the change appears quite large. However, if one calculated the trends for Jan 1999-Dec 2016 instead, the trends increases by a factor of about 1.6, not 2.6, only a 60% increase. Of course this is still a pretty large increase. The sentence also ignores the other sources of lower-tropospheric satellite data. The newer version of the UAH (Version 6.0) data shows less warming than the previous version. Also, the radiosonde datasets show more warming over this period that any of the satellite datasets (except maybe UAH V5.6), and have done so for years.

"“That isn’t all that ocean acidification can do. Carbon absorption can initiate a feedback loop in which underoxygenated waters breed different kinds of microbes that turn the water still more “anoxic,” first in deep ocean “dead zones,” then gradually up toward the surface[…]This process, in which dead zones grow like cancers, choking off marine life and wiping out fisheries, is already quite advanced in parts of the Gulf of Mexico and just off Namibia, where hydrogen sulfide is bubbling out of the sea along a thousand-mile stretch of land known as the ‘Skeleton Coast.’”","Ocean acidification per se doesn’t enhance anoxia: anoxia (loss of oxygen) results from warming (warm water holds less dissolved gas like oxygen), which would be the consequence of atmospheric CO2 buildup, as might more sluggish ocean mixing. It also is enhanced by increased nutrient delivery to the ocean from more rain and river flow on land under the warmer climate. More nutrients mean more algae growth in the uppermost ocean, more decaying organic matter below the surface, and thus less oxygen. Low oxygen zones would spread as the ocean became warmer and river flow increased as the event progressed. When oxygen is exhausted, bacteria do “breathe” other oxygen-containing compounds including sulfate and respire hydrogen sulfide. The coast of Namibia does experience these extreme conditions episodically, but such conditions are unlikely to spread globally until centuries to millennia of warming and eutrophication have occurred. Hydrogen sulfide likely contributed to the mass extinction, but the warming itself as well as other volcanic emanations like chlorine, fluorine, and sulfur dioxide were equally if not more important drivers of the extinction.

Which cloud effect ultimately wins out has to do with the optical thickness of the cloud (how reflective it is) and (as a rough approximation), the cloud height. As a quick rule: Higher clouds will act better as a blanket since they are both colder (and therefore radiate less energy to space) and typically optically thin.

One could easily model other actions with much lower costs. Second, it is only the costs that are modeled. The benefits from avoiding climate change (sea level rise, greater storm surges, greater spread of diseases, etc.) are entirely ignored. The net costs from the policies would be entirely different and likely even positive. Third, there is some cherry-picking going on here.

The enigma refers to a key discrepancy between the amount of sea-level rise believed to have occurred during the 20th century and the effects it should have produced on the planet — specifically, on the Earth’s rotation. So in addition to all the devastating and obvious effects sea-level rise will produce on the planet, such as flooding and erosion, sea-level rise also has the more subtle, but nonetheless mind-boggling ability to alter the way the Earth rotates on its axis. In a recent paper, Jerry Mitrovica and an interdisciplinary team of colleagues claim to have resolved the enigma.

"“while it’s true that studies in some regions show polar bears are lighter in weight than they were in the 1980s, there is no evidence that more individuals are starving to death or becoming too thin to reproduce because of less summer ice.”","There is evidence. Bromaghin et al 20151 and Hunter et al 20102 examine this issue. Bromaghin et al state, “Low survival from 2004 through 2006 led to a 25–50% decline in abundance. We hypothesize that low survival during this period resulted from (1) unfavorable ice conditions that limited access to prey during multiple seasons; and possibly, (2) low prey abundance. For reasons that are not clear, survival of adults and cubs began to improve in 2007 and abundance was comparatively stable from 2008 to 2010, with ~900 bears in 2010 (90% CI 606–1212). However, survival of subadult bears declined throughout the entire period. Reduced spatial and temporal availability of sea ice is expected to increasingly force population dynamics of polar bears as the climate continues to warm. However, in the short term, our findings suggest that factors other than sea ice can influence survival.” Hunter et al stated, “Deterministic models projected population growth in years with more extensive ice coverage (2001-2003) and population decline in years with less ice coverage (2004-2005). LTRE (life table response experiment) analysis showed that the reduction in lambda in years with low sea ice was due primarily to reduced adult female survival, and secondarily to reduced breeding. A stochastic model with two environmental states, good and poor sea ice conditions, projected a declining stochastic growth rate, log lambda(s), as the frequency of poor ice years increased. The observed frequency of poor ice years since 1979 would imply log lambda(s) approximate to -0.01, which agrees with available (albeit crude) observations of population size. The stochastic model was linked to a set of 10 GCMs compiled by the IPCC; the models were chosen for their ability to reproduce historical observations of sea ice and were forced with “business as usual” (A1B) greenhouse gas emissions. The resulting stochastic population projections showed drastic declines in the polar bear population by the end of the 21st century. These projections were instrumental in the decision to list the polar bear as a threatened species under the U. S.

Castro de la Guarida1 states, “Sea ice across the Arctic is declining and altering physical characteristics of marine ecosystems. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have been identified as vulnerable to changes in sea ice conditions. We use sea ice projections for the Canadian Arctic Archipelago from 2006 – 2100 to gain insight into the conservation challenges for polar bears with respect to habitat loss using metrics developed from polar bear energetics modeling. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Shifts away from multiyear ice to annual ice cover throughout the region, as well as lengthening ice-free periods, may become critical for polar bears before the end of the 21st century with projected warming. Each polar bear population in the Archipelago may undergo 2-5 months of ice-free conditions, where no such conditions exist presently. We identify spatially and temporally explicit ice-free periods that extend beyond what polar bears require for nutritional and reproductive demands. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Under business-as-usual climate projections, polar bears may face starvation and reproductive failure across the entire Archipelago by the year 2100.” Both of these studies1,2 assess the threat to polar bears based on projected sea ice loss over the next 3 generations (ca. 33-45 years). It is an issue of fasting duration that causes polar bear population declines and this is well understood in the published literature. Dr. Crockford is following the standard climate change denier approach of picking on a specific detail and then contriving an unsubstantiated fictional account on that point. Loss of sea ice in summer is, by and large, irrelevant. It’s the duration of the ice-free period that matters. If not, polar bears in Hudson Bay would have disappeared hundreds or thousands of years ago but they didn’t because they used to be able to obtain sufficient fat stores while hunting seals on the sea ice in spring. The situation is changing but the best estimate is that we’ll have significant declines in the Western Hudson Bay population (beyond the current ca. 30% decline) by mid-century. By repeating it often enough, it appears that deniers or the uninformed think there’s some merit to the issue Dr. Crockford has raised.

It is the ability of a gas to absorb radiation, and so affect energy balance of the Earth, not its concentration, which is important. This effect on Earth’s energy balance can be quantified by the radiative forcing (RF); a positive RF means a surface warming effect and a negative RF a cooling. The figure below, from the 2013 IPCC report shows estimates of RF for a range of factors which have influenced climate from 1750-2011. As can be seen, increasing carbon dioxide concentrations have the largest RF and therefore the largest impact on climate.

"“In other words, we have, trapped in Arctic permafrost, twice as much carbon as is currently wrecking the atmosphere of the planet, all of it scheduled to be released at a date that keeps getting moved up, partially in the form of a gas that multiplies its warming power 86 times over.”","Most work on studying the dynamics of greenhouse gas balance in degrading permafrost systems, both as based on field measurements and as represented in ecosystem models for making climate feedback projections, seems to point to methane release being a relatively minor pathway for permafrost carbon to be released to the atmosphere, at least for terrestrial permafrost sources (which comprise most of the carbon mentioned here). It is true that terrestrial permafrost systems emit methane, but most of that methane is from recently photosynthesized carbon rather than older permafrost sources, and most of the carbon released from the older permafrost sources is released as either carbon dioxide or dissolved organic carbon rather than methane. So, while uncertainty on this issue remains high, and permafrost thaw is a potentially strong feedback process, this feedback seems likely to be dominated by carbon dioxide rather than methane. A specifically misleading thing about these numbers, which are a metric called “global warming potential”, is that their units are based on the mass of the gas. Since the question here is whether a given atom of carbon will be emitted to the atmosphere contained within either a molecule of carbon dioxide or a molecule of methane, you have to take into account the fact that the molecule of carbon dioxide is much heavier, because of the two oxygen atoms it picks up in the transformation to that gas, versus the four hydrogen atoms it would acquire in becoming methane. What this means in practice is that you have to divide the global warming potential by the ratio of the weight of the molecules, which is 44/16 or 2.75. So strictly speaking, the 34 and 86 ought to read 12 and 31.

“over 20 years of almost no change in temperatures”,"Bastos There has been a slow-down in global mean surface (troposphere) temperatures, but this does not call into question the fact that the Earth-system as a whole is warming. In fact, during the so-called “hiatus”, the net radiation imbalance in the top of the atmosphere persisted (implying that warming would continue even if emissions were to stop). In fact, at the same time that warming in the troposphere stalled, ocean heat content increased, especially in deeper layers: The fact that oceans took more heat from the atmosphere helps to explain the slow-down of warming at the surface. This seems to be, at least partly, explained by natural variability in the ocean (see here). Trenberth* argued, thus, that natural variability in the climate system makes the global mean surface temperature record increase in steps, rather than in a linear way. In another study, Yan and colleagues* analysed the redistribution of heat during the “hiatus” period and concluded that: “[…] the term ‘global warming hiatus’ is a misnomer, although we will continue to use the widely used phrase to describe the slowdown or pause in the increase of GMST in the late 20th to early 21st century, with quotation marks.

"“Sea level rise is global. But due to a variety of factors – including, for this part of the Atlantic coast, a likely weakening of the Gulf Stream, itself potentially a result of the melting of Greenland’s ice caps – south Floridians are feeling the effects more than many others. While there has been a mean rise of a little more than 3mm per year worldwide since the 1990s, in the last decade, the NOAA Virginia Key tide gauge just south of Miami Beach has measured a 9mm rise annually.”","This statement touches upon several issues that are indeed discussed in the scientific literature and it is essentially correct. Let’s try and disentangle things. It is correct that Virginia Key as well as other locations on the US Atlantic coast have experienced a surge of rapid sea-level rise during the past ten years or so. However, this is a very short period in terms of sea-level variations. The longer-term rise in this region (when corrected for local land subsidence) is actually in line with the global average sea-level rise, both for the past hundred years (~1.8mm per year) or measured since the early 1990s (~3 mm per year). The recent rapid rise is thus likely a short-term natural variation (a possibility mentioned later in the article) and may well be followed by a period of very little rise. In the longer run I would expect that sea-level near Miami would continue to increase roughly in line with the global mean sea-level rise, as is indeed discussed later in the article where the future projections with their uncertainties are covered well. It is correct that local sea-level rise can differ from global sea-level rise due to “a variety of factors”, including a weakening of the Gulf Stream. For the relevant period of rapid rise, the last ten years or so, such a weakening has been documented, e.g. in the direct measurements in the RAPID section at 26 °N. So the rapid sea-level rise and the weakening of the larger Gulf Stream System coincide, and have indeed been linked.* Like with sea level, over the short time scale of the past decade this is likely to be dominated by natural variability, although there are also indications of a longer-term, probably human-caused, downward trend. Greenland melting has not caused this, but likely contributed to it. To what extent the Gulf Stream weakening explains the recent rapid sea-level rise in Miami, and to what extent other factors—like changes in the predominant winds—are responsible remains an open research question.

The idea that climate change is producing heat records across the Earth is among the most egregious manipulations of data in the absurd global warming debate.,"Just to be clear, the main claim of climate science is that the global average temperature is increasing. The increase of heat waves is one of the many consequences of this. The article confusingly uses the term “record” in two meanings. The term records can be used for the observations that were recorded by meteorologists over the last centuries. The term “records” is mostly used for the highest or lowest value ever seen. In an article about the highest and lowest temperatures, it is best to avoid using the term records for the recorded data. The article also confusingly keeps on jumping between claims about local records in daily mean temperatures and claims about the long-term global mean temperature. Local temperatures are by their nature more variable than global average temperatures, daily temperatures are by their nature more variable than long-term average temperatures, records are by their nature more random than averages. With all the extra variability in the local daily records the authors can easily cherry pick a few data points that fit their narrative. What would make their case stronger would be if they actually analysed all the data, engaged with the existing scientific literature and made their own contribution to our scientific understanding by publishing a scientific paper.

The atmosphere, if CO2 were removed from it, would cool enough that much of the water vapor would rain out. That precipitation, in turn, would cause further cooling and ultimately spiral Earth into a globally glaciated snowball state. It is only the present of CO2 that keeps Earth’s atmosphere warm enough to contain much water vapor.” I like to think of CO2 as analogous to a military commander and water vapor as analogous to an army of foot soldiers.

“The human contribution can be up to 30 percent or so of the total rainfall coming out of the storm”,"Climate change doesn’t cause events like this, but probably makes them worse by making storms (which are strong to begin with) more intense and enhancing rainfall in that process.

It is consistent with what’s predicted for the future, though. However, I’m not exactly sure where the “30 percent” number comes from for the human contribution to rainfall. For every one degree increase in sea surface temperature, the saturation vapor pressure increases by about 7% based on the “Clausius-Clapeyron” equation.

“But the observed warming as monitored by satellites (our only truly global monitoring system) has been only about half of what computerized climate models say should be happening.”,"The statement is fairly accurate but leaves the inference of causes up to the reader. A recent paper by Santer et al. (2016)* investigated this issue in considerable detail. For middle tropospheric temperatures the paper found that, on average, models showed 1.71 times more warming than the mean of the most recent version of the satellite data for the 1979-2015 period. This is for near global mean temperatures. For the lower troposphere, the models show about 2 times more warming than the satellites. Note that the Remote Sensing Systems lower tropospheric dataset has not yet been upgraded to the latest version, which is likely to show more warming. The article does not discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, but given the tone of the rest of the article, the reader is expected to use the trend differences as evidence that long-term projections by climate models are suspect. These ratios do not provide such evidence. At least part of the discrepancy is known to be caused by errors in the forcings used to drive the CMIP-5 climate models. After the year 2000, the CMIP-5 models were driven by forecast values for important parameters such as volcanic aerosols, solar output, and stratospheric ozone. The forecasts turned out to be slightly inaccurate, causing the models to predict more warming than they would have if the correct forcings had been used. (Of course, these correct forcings were in the future and thus unknowable at the time the model computations were performed). Other possible causes include natural variability in the real world (which might produce a period of reduced warming) and errors in the model physics. Only errors in the model physics would cause long-term global warming to be overestimated, and there is no significant evidence that supports large errors in the model physics. Over a much longer time period, 1880-present, the warming at the surface agrees well with that expected by the CMIP-5 models. The longer time period is important because the effects of random fluctuations due to natural variability tend to average away as the time period considered gets longer. Santer et al.

Additional moisture is also evaporated from the open ocean, which not only traps additional heat as a greenhouse gas, but also tends to form more clouds that also trap heat. An unusually wavy jet-stream pattern has also transported extra heat and moisture from lower-latitude regions into the Arctic, adding to the warmth.

“[CO2] is also a greenhouse gas which helps maintain earth at a habitable temperature.”,"While the presence of CO2 has warmed the atmosphere to “habitable” temperatures, the additional increase of it will bring temperatures way outside habitable ranges in many regions including the oceans, as well as disturbing the water cycle and acidifying the oceans.",Train,Cherry Picking,"Title: ""The Dual Nature of CO2""
Fact: Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a naturally occurring gas that plays a complex role in the Earth's climate system. On the one hand, it is a greenhouse gas that helps to trap heat and maintain the Earth's temperature within a habitable range. On the other hand, when concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere increase due to human activities, it can contribute to climate change by causing the Earth's temperature to rise.
Myth: Some people believe that because CO2 helps maintain the Earth's temperature, it cannot contribute to climate change.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false dichotomy, as it suggests that CO2 can only have one effect on the Earth's climate. In reality, CO2 has a dual nature - it is both a greenhouse gas that helps maintain the Earth's temperature and a contributor to climate change when concentrations in the atmosphere become too high.

Overall, we conclude that the increase in heat-related mortality by mid-century will outweigh gains due to fewer cold periods, especially in tropical developing countries with limited adaptive capacities and large exposed populations” So the US report does not appear wildly at odds with the literature on the topic, or to be “pushing too hard”.

"“CO2 is certainly a heat-trapping greenhouse gas, but hardly the primary one: Water vapor accounts for about 95 percent of greenhouse gases. By contrast, carbon dioxide is only a trace component in the atmosphere: about 400 ppm (parts per million), or 0.04 percent.”","First, it is true that water vapor constitutes the bulk of Earth’s present-day greenhouse effect (measured in terms of infrared absorption). Quantitatively, however, Jacoby is off by quite a bit. In fact, water vapor constitutes ~50% of the terrestrial greenhouse effect, not 95% (see here*). Clouds (solid and liquid water that form when the vapor condenses) constitute another ~25%, but CO2 contributes to almost all of the remaining fraction (only ~5% or so from all of the other combined gases). This is because CO2 still absorbs well in spectral regions where water vapor doesn’t, and also because the upper troposphere is very dry; the ability to absorb intense surface emission and re-emit it at colder, higher layers of the atmosphere is critical for the maintenance of a planetary greenhouse effect. Secondly, the water vapor greenhouse effect is not independent of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Jacoby stresses that CO2 is only a trace component of the atmosphere, an argument that is irritatingly unoriginal and provides useless context when describing the flow of radiation through the atmosphere. As before, CO2 accounts for ~20% of Earth’s greenhouse effect. N2 and O2 account for nearly all of Earth’s atmospheric mass. However, if the atmosphere were purely N2 and O2, the planet would likely be in a snowball state due to the lack of greenhouse trapping. This is where the equations of radiative transfer must be applied, rather than a naive intuition about proportions.

",Train,Red Herring,"Title: ""The Role of CO2 and Water Vapor in Climate Change""
Fact: Carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor are both important greenhouse gases that play a role in the Earth's climate system. Water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, accounting for about 95% of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, while CO2 is a trace gas that makes up about 0.04% of the atmosphere.
Myth: Some people believe that because water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, the role of CO2 as a greenhouse gas is not significant.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false equivalence, as it incorrectly assumes that the abundance of a greenhouse gas determines its significance in the Earth's climate system. In reality, the warming effect of CO2 is not determined solely by its abundance, but also by its potency as a greenhouse gas and its ability to trap heat in the atmosphere.
Fact: While water vapor is the most abundant greenhouse gas, CO2 still plays a significant role in the Earth's climate system as a greenhouse gas. Increases in atmospheric CO2 levels have been linked to increases in global temperatures and changes in weather patterns.

the models predicted seven times as much warming as has been observed,"The op-ed authors reference the 2017 State of the Climate Report. I helped prepare the “Lower and Mid-Tropospheric Temperature” section and it is unclear where the authors’ statistic comes from (“seven times as much warming…”). The average CMIP5 model warming in the tropical troposphere does outpace observations (by a factor of 1.5 – 3.3, depending on dataset). This issue deserves (and has received) scrutiny.1,2,3,4,5,6 The difference in warming rates between observations and models largely arises in the early 2000s. A number of assessments have concluded that this slowdown in warming in the 2000s is in part due to natural variability (the Earth’s warming was slowed due to climate variability) and forcing (the real world experienced different solar and volcanic aerosol forcing than what was used in the models). Models do simulate natural “hiatus” periods like that experienced in the early 2000s, but, since they are random, they generally do not occur at the same times as in the real world (though some models happened to have a slowdown in warming in the early 2000s). Furthermore, forcing agents (greenhouse gases, aerosols, solar changes) are prescribed to models. Since we do not know the exact evolution of forcing agents for future projections, they are estimated. In this case, the estimated forcing was different than what occurred in the real world. When these issues are taken into account, models and observations are in agreement. Over long periods, when natural variability is a smaller issue, models and observations agree on the rate of warming. Assessments of model projections of climate change show that models have typically been quite skillful (e.g. here). 1- IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis (Ch. 9, Box 9.2) 2- Meehl et al (2014) Climate model simulations of the observed early-2000s hiatus of global warming, Nature Climate Change 3- Gleisner et al (2015) Recent global warming hiatus dominated by low‐latitude temperature trends in surface and troposphere data, Geophysical Research Letters 4- Medhaug et al (2017) Reconciling controversies about the ‘global warming hiatus’, Nature 5- Santer et al (2017) Comparing Tropospheric Warming in Climate Models and Satellite Data, Journal of Climate 6- Santer et al (2017b) Causes of differences in model and satellite tropospheric warming ",Train,Strawman,"Title: ""Climate Model Predictions and Observed Warming""

"“Sea level rise, which was occurring long before humans could be blamed, has not accelerated and still amounts to only 1 inch every ten years. If a major hurricane is approaching with a predicted storm surge of 10-14 feet, are you really going to worry about a sea level rise of 1 inch per decade?”","Proxy analysis has clearly shown an acceleration in rate of sea-level rise. Our research* found that the rate of sea-level rise on the US Atlantic coast is greater now than at any time in the past 2,000 years. The research also shows a consistent link between global mean surface temperature and changes in sea level for the past millennium. The study shows that after relatively subtle changes in temperature and sea-level rise over the last 2,000 years, the rate of sea-level rise increased in the late 19th century. Sea-level rise contributes significantly to the frequency of flooding from hurricanes. The contribution from sea-level rise to flood height works in together with other factors such as timing of the storm relative to high tide, and the strength and direction of individual hurricanes. Sea-level rise between hurricanes raises the “baseline” water level and makes flooding more likely. We published another paper* showing that New York City can expect nine-foot floods, as intense as that produced by 2012’s Superstorm Sandy, at least four times more frequently over the next century. We report that floods as intense as Sandy’s would have occurred about once every 400 years on average under present day sea-level rise conditions, but that over the 21st century are expected to be about four times more probable (once every 100 years) due to an acceleration in the rate of sea-level rise.

Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false equivalence, as it suggests that a short-term event, such as a hurricane, is equivalent to the long-term impact of sea level rise. In reality, sea level rise is a gradual process that can have significant impacts on the environment and human populations over time.
Fact: While sea level rise has been occurring for thousands of years, it has accelerated in recent decades due to human activities and is expected to continue to accelerate in the future.

"Scientists such as Dr Willie Soon, a solar astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, have shown that as water vapour rises, so does temperature. It is why cloudless nights are so chilly.","The water vapor feedback is one of the main positive feedbacks in the climate system. It has been well understood for much of the century that increased temperatures will increase the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, trapping additional heat. This is by no means a controversial topic in the scientific community, fringe views by Willie Soon notwithstanding. Water vapor cannot be a forcing because of its extremely short atmospheric lifetime in the troposphere. Adding a bunch of additional water vapor won’t cause long-term changes, at it will quickly precipitate out. However, the absolute amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is strongly determined by the temperature; warm the planet (e.g. by increasing CO2 concentrations) and you will end up with more water vapor in the air. This is why water vapor is a feedback rather than a forcing. This RealClimate post provides some good background on the role of water vapor as a climate feedback.",Dev,No Fallacy,"Title: ""The Relationship Between Water Vapor and Temperature""
Fact: Water vapor is a greenhouse gas that plays a significant role in the Earth's climate system. When water vapor is present in the atmosphere, it traps heat and warms the Earth's surface, leading to climate change.

Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of cherry-picking, as it selectively presents only one aspect of the relationship between water vapor and temperature. In reality, the warming effect of water vapor is closely tied to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the two factors work together to influence the Earth's climate. It is also important to consider the full body of evidence and research on the topic, rather than relying on the views of a single scientist.

"“Consider where they move. Migration patterns show people heading for warm states like Texas and Florida, not snowy Minnesota and Michigan.”","People don’t like the cold, they like sunshine and warmth, and (supposedly as a result, according to Lomborg), they move to the South: does Lomborg really want us to deduce from that that global warming will thus be good for us – even simply in terms of temperature-related deaths? That’s not reasonable. First, while people have indeed generally been moving from the North(-East) to the South over the last decades, it’s not only because of “better climate”: quoting this article by the Washington Post, “Several long-term trends dating as far back as the 1960s are behind this larger pattern. The rise of air conditioning and interstate highways have made once-sleepy (and sweltering) Southern cities more appealing. And, over the same time, the decline of industrial jobs in the Midwest and Northeast have pushed people out. Cheap housing during the boom years also drove growth in states such as Arizona and Nevada“. I think that is already much more reasonable than saying that people move South only because they know they are less likely to die from cold exposure there. Second, people may be moving there right now partly because of climate, and that may indeed be a “smart” move because, TODAY, indeed, current cold-related deaths outnumber heat-related deaths. However, even supposing that this is a significant factor in their decision process, it’s not clear that they are also thinking about future warming. So the fact that people are moving there NOW does not even logically imply, as Lomborg would have it, that FUTURE warming will be beneficial – which is the point of interest here.",Train,Red Herring,"Title: ""Migration and Climate Change""

The authors of the study admit on pages 10-11 to making the astonishing assumption that every other country in the world ignores the targets in their nationally determined contributions and make no further efforts to reduce emissions, so that much of the calculated costs to the United States economy subsequently arise from high-carbon companies relocate or lose business to competitors in other countries. The model assumes no increase in low-carbon electricity generation over the next four decades compared with the baseline scenario, so no increase in economic growth or jobs in the low-carbon sector and no substitution of low-carbon energy for high-carbon energy—emissions reductions are achieved by imposing very high carbon prices that reduce the consumption of coal and energy.

"“Late 20th century and early 21st century global warming, they show, is neither dramatic, nor unusual, nor scary. Here … are just some of the charts to prove it.”","The four charts presented in the Breitbart article purport to demonstrate that the industrial epoch warming is simply a giant natural fluctuation. But it shows nothing of the sort; it is based on a complete misunderstanding of the space-time variability of the atmosphere. The article commits two common, but fundamental errors that totally invalidate its claims. The first two charts are both of spatially global scale (the northern hemisphere), they illustrate the time scale error. They show northern hemisphere temperatures with millennial scale fluctuations (changes) of the order of 1°C; the so-called “medieval warming event”. Irrespective of whether these reconstructions are accurate (the global—not European—extent of the warming is the question under debate), the change occurred over time scales much longer than the 1°C warming that occurred over the last century. In the pre-industrial period, typical century long, global scale temperature fluctuations were about 0.2°C (i.e. typical century to century changes, see figure below); therefore if the temperature fluctuations followed the usual “bell-curve”, then a 1°C change in a century would have a probability of about one in 3 million of occurring naturally, the giant natural fluctuation hypothesis could easily be rejected. However, it was found that the bell curve under estimates the extreme 3% of the temperature fluctuations: extreme “black swan” events occur much more frequently than expected, yet, even when these rare extremes are taken into account, the probability of a 1°C change in a century is still less than 0.1%, it can easily be rejected1. The other fundamental error is also a scale error, but now in space rather than in time. This error is well exemplified in the fourth graph which shows data indirectly reflecting temperatures in France. Yet France is only about 0.1% of the global surface area, so that large natural fluctuations are common but are not of global significance. A common “skeptic” talking point is the fact that between 1662 and 1762, the temperature in central England increased by nearly 1 °C, i.e., about the same as the global temperature over the last century. Unfortunately for the “skeptics”, central England (greater London) is about 0.01% of the earth’s surface area so that it is not surprising that over the same period, the Northern Hemisphere temperature only increased by 0.2 °C (equal to the typical centennial change!). Finally, the third graph from China combines the two errors: the times scales are way too long and the spatial scales are way too small; it is doubly irrelevant to the question of anthropogenic global warming.

"“Moreover, its warming impact decreases sharply after the first 20 or 30 ppm. Adding more CO2 molecules to the atmosphere is like painting over a red wall with white paint — the first coat does most of the work of concealing the red. A second coat of paint has much less of an effect, while adding a third or fourth coat has almost no impact at all.”","This is flawed reasoning as it is not a sensible analogy for how the greenhouse effect works. The science is more complex: Namely, radiation from the surface at a warmer temperature is absorbed in the layers above which are at a colder temperature; the colder layers emit less radiation so that there is a net loss of radiative energy escaping to space from the atmosphere-surface system as a whole, but coming about due to the “exchange” as formulated. This is true in absorption bands that are transparent and not opaque—i.e., in bands that are not saturated. In bands that are opaque, the radiation emanating from the layer to space represents a “cooling-to-space” and this too represents a “trapping”. In this regard, the lapse-rate and decrease of temperature with height (in the troposphere) are important. The more CO2 that is added to the atmosphere, the more heat that is “trapped” in the climate system, although it is not 1:1 and is instead a logarithmic relationship.

We directed him to both modern (as published in Feely et al., 2008) and historical pH measurements archived at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. We cautioned him that the earlier data sets prior to 1989 had significant issues with data quality as described in the document that went along with the data set obtained from NCEI. Mr. Wallace went on to perform his analysis of the historical data without regard for the oceanographic community’s concerns about the data quality or for the proper methodology to perform this kind of analysis.

We responded by correcting the record by formally restating our concerns about Mr. Wallace’s incorrect use of the historical data on our website. In short, Wallace’s chart does not show any kind of useful trend in global ocean pH because the data he used, and the way he used them, were not appropriate for this kind of analysis. In the first place, the pH measurements prior to 1989 were not reliable enough to detect small pH changes over that period. In addition, companion meta data on sensor calibration, pH scales, and temperature corrections were not available.

"“Instead of a three-foot increase in ocean levels by the end of the century, six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings. But if carbon emissions continue to track on something resembling a worst-case scenario, the full 11 feet of ice locked in West Antarctica might be freed up, their study showed.”","The study referenced1 finds that, assuming some different possible scenarios for the speed of ice sheet processes and the IPCC’s highest emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), Antarctica alone can contribute anywhere from 0.5 to 4.5 feet (Figure 5b and d, below) of sea level rise. The DeConto & Pollard study1 does not include the potential for sea level rise from thermal expansion of sea water, melting of mountain glaciers or the Greenland Ice Sheet in it’s projections, but if these are included, the total sea level rise projected for 2100 may be something like 6 feet. If this is the calculation implicit in this statement that “…six feet was more likely, according to DeConto and Pollard’s findings”, than it is perhaps a bit misleading, since DeConto & Pollard is only focused on the contribution from the Antarctic Ice Sheet. As DeConto & Pollard say in their study: “…the rates of ice loss simulated here should not be viewed as actual predictions, but rather as possible envelopes of behaviour”. Determining the “likely” amount of sea level rise in the future is a prediction that is strongly dependent on the assumptions about how ice sheet behave and on what time scales. Based on just DeConto & Pollard’s studies, and the assumptions inherent in their model, one can conclude that it is likely that sea level will rise by more than 11 feet, just from Antarctic melting, over the next several centuries, if humans do not significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (see Figure 5 and S7 of DeConto & Pollard 2016). What the glaciological community as a whole considers “likely” depends on which processes we think are likely to be important contributors of ice sheet collapse, which is a matter that is actively under debate. Since the DeConto & Pollard study is relatively new, there is still an ongoing discussion about how likely it is that the Marine Ice Cliff Instability will actually occur and at what rate will it causes ice to be lost from individual glaciers.

Fact: Climate change is a complex issue that involves many factors, including the role of plants in the Earth's climate system. Plants can absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis, which can help to mitigate the effects of climate change.
Myth: Some climate change skeptics and contrarians believe that plants can offset any global warming trend, and that climate change won't be all bad.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of oversimplification, as it suggests that the role of plants in climate change is simple and straightforward. In reality, the relationship between plants and climate change is complex and depends on many factors, including temperature, precipitation, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations.
Fact: While plants can help to mitigate the effects of climate change by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, they are not a panacea that can offset the impacts of global warming. Climate change will have many negative impacts on ecosystems and human societies, and we need to take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

"People who study the impacts of global warming have found that if ECS is low — say, less than two — then the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and, in many places, mildly beneficial. If it is very low, for instance around one, it means greenhouse gas emissions are simply not worth doing anything about.","This passage is misleading. It seems to imply that society has already decided to exactly double CO2 concentrations and has committed to emitting no further greenhouse gasses after that. If that were the case, then we could in fact assess climate change impacts in the manner done here. However, society is far from committing to stabilizing CO2 concentrations at “only” twice their preindustrial levels. We may go well beyond that. In that case, lower equilibrium climate sensitivity just means that it takes longer to reach a given level of warming. So even if climate sensitivity turns out to be very low, all the worst impacts could still be realized—they would just be delayed.",Train,Evading the Burden of Proof,"Title: ""ECS and the Impacts of Global Warming""
Fact: ECS (Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity) is a measure of how sensitive the Earth's climate is to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, particularly CO2. It is used to estimate how much the Earth's temperature would increase if the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere were to double.
Myth: Some people believe that if ECS is low, the impacts of global warming on the economy will be mostly small and may even be beneficial.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of oversimplification, as it suggests that the impacts of global warming can be reduced to a single factor (ECS) and that low ECS values mean that the impacts will be small or beneficial. In reality, the impacts of global warming are complex and depend on many different factors, including sea-level rise, changes in precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events.
Fact: While ECS is an important factor in understanding the impacts of global warming, it is only one of many factors that must be considered. Even if ECS is low, global warming can still have significant negative impacts on the economy and the environment, including loss of biodiversity, increased health risks, and damage to infrastructure.

"“The term ocean acidification was also a misnomer, he said, because it suggested that the oceans could become acidic instead of alkaline.” ",This is like saying that it is wrong to say the Arctic is warming because it is still cold. ‘Warming’ and ‘acidifying’ both refer to a direction of change and do not specify the state of the system. This claim about a misnomer is based on a misunderstanding of how words are used.,Test,Strawman,"Title: ""Understanding Ocean Acidification""
Fact: Ocean acidification refers to the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, which is caused by the absorption of excess carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. As more CO2 dissolves in seawater, it creates carbonic acid, which lowers the pH of the ocean and makes it more acidic.
Myth: Some people believe that the term ""ocean acidification"" is a misnomer, because it suggests that the oceans can become acidic instead of alkaline.
Fallacy: This myth is based on a misunderstanding of the chemistry of ocean acidification. While it is true that the oceans are alkaline, with a pH of around 8.1 on average, the ongoing absorption of excess CO2 is causing the pH of the oceans to decline. This is making the ocean less alkaline and more acidic, even if it never becomes truly acidic.
Fact: The term ""ocean acidification"" accurately describes the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans, which is caused by the absorption of excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

At four degrees, the deadly European heat wave of 2003, which killed as many as 2,000 people a day, will be a normal summer. At six[…] summer labor of any kind would become impossible in the lower Mississippi Valley, and everybody in the country east of the Rockies would be under more heat stress than anyone, anywhere, in the world today[…].”","The article highlights worst case projections of the intensity of heatwaves, but not of their frequency. Projections indicate return periods of high-mortality heatwaves will shorten over the century and, in some cases, the length of these high-mortality heatwaves will increase.  That does not mean these events will occur every day during a summer. In many regions, this means a high-mortality heatwave could occur could approach becoming an annual event instead of rarely. Further, the projections do not take into account that increased heat-related hazards are only one factor that influences future risks. The other factors are the extent of exposure, the vulnerability of the exposed population, and the capacity of individuals and communities to prepare for and manage heatwaves. There is growing literature that sensitivity to heatwaves has declined over recent decades, presumably because of some degree of acclimatization to ever higher temperatures, increasing access to air conditioning and cooling centers, better understanding and communication of the risks of high ambient temperatures, and changing infrastructure to reduce urban heat islands.  Recent projections using different approaches that take these changes into account show that taking these factors into account decreases the magnitude of risks.

“The extreme cycles of dry and wet weather appear to have been intensifying over the last three decades.”,"Yes, variability in California precipitation appears to have been higher in the past 3-4 decades than the previous decades, but it is not (and cannot be) clear that that the variability in precipitation is actually currently in the act of increasing. I say that it cannot be clear because it takes decades of data (say 2-3) to characterize the current “variability” of the climate. Based on my calculations, variability in annual precipitation totals increased considerably during the second half of the 1900s and then has remained at this relatively high level for the past couple decades, but has not clearly continued to increase. This latest swing from record dry to very wet in the last year is consistent with high variability, but it’s a single event and not necessarily indicative of a trend. There are some logical links, however, that support the inference that wild swings like the current one should be expected to become more likely. First, droughts are becoming increasingly impacted by warming temperatures. Even if precipitation behavior didn’t change at all, years with low precipitation would correspond to less and less water availability for humans and ecosystems. Second, current climate models project variability of California precipitation to increase in the future, with an increase in the frequency of years with very high precipitation totals becoming detectable sometime in the first half of this century, and an increase in the frequency of years with very low precipitation totals becoming detectable in the second half of this century*. It should always be remembered, however, that models have a tough time with California precipitation. California is right on the boundary between projections of drying to the south and wetting to the north. I personally believe the basic expectation that California precipitation should become more variable, but beyond that I don’t yet put much stock in what models have to say about the future of precipitation in California. So, variability has increased overall in the last century, and this is consistent with what models project to occur as a result of greenhouse-gas driven climate change. The increase in variability hasn’t been a monotonic trend, however, and it is not obvious from the data that the trend is continuing now as rapidly as it was in previous decades. This suggests that other low-frequency processes are also at play that influence decade-to-decade changes in the variability and magnitude of annual precipitation totals, making it particularly difficult to determine the degree to which this current event can be attributed to climate change. Nonetheless, California would be wise to prepare for more events like these.

Fact: Climate change is causing global temperatures to rise, leading to more frequent and intense heat waves. Heat records are measurements of temperature that exceed previous highs for a given location and time period.
Myth: Some people believe that climate change heat records are a result of data manipulation and not a true reflection of changing temperatures.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false accusation, as it suggests that climate scientists are manipulating data to create false records of rising temperatures. In reality, heat records are based on accurate measurements of temperature and are a reflection of the real-world impacts of climate change.
Fact: Heat records are a legitimate and important way of tracking the impacts of climate change on global temperatures and human health. Attempts to discredit them as a result of data manipulation are unfounded and ignore the overwhelming evidence of rising temperatures caused by human activities.

"“Global warming is largely being driven by emissions from human activities, but a strong El Niño – a natural climate cycle – added to the heat in 2016.”","Yes, as stated in the last IPCC report, human emissions of greenhouse gases have been the dominant driver of climate change since the mid-20th century. No other changes (such as the output of the Sun) can adequately explain the observed warming.",Test,No Fallacy,"Title: ""Global Warming and Natural Climate Cycles""
Fact: Global warming refers to the long-term increase in the Earth's average surface temperature, largely due to emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities like burning fossil fuels and deforestation. This increase in temperature is causing significant changes in the Earth's climate, including more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and extreme weather events.
Myth: Some people believe that a strong El Niño in 2016 was solely responsible for the increase in global temperatures that year, and that human activities are not a major driver of global warming.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false equivalence, as it suggests that a natural climate cycle like El Niño is equivalent in importance to the long-term trend of global warming caused by human activities. In reality, while El Niño can contribute to short-term fluctuations in global temperatures, it does not negate the long-term trend of global warming caused by human activities.
Fact: While a strong El Niño in 2016 did contribute to the high global temperatures that year, it was not solely responsible for the long-term trend of global warming caused by human activities. Human activities continue to be the primary driver of global warming, and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases remains crucial for mitigating the impacts of climate change.

“Policy makers who want to help the residents of the Marshall Islands today should look at improving the islands’ resilience”,"This is a classic technique in Lomborg’s articles: he focuses on one small aspect of climate change – here the Marshall Islands, other times maybe polar bears or heat-related human deaths – that i) he passes off as the main concern about global warming, and ii) that he can provide some seemingly contradictory information about… All the other consequences of global warming are conveniently set aside… Red herring.",Train,Red Herring,"Title: ""Improving Resilience in the Marshall Islands""
Fact: The Marshall Islands are a low-lying island nation in the Pacific Ocean that are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise and increased storm intensity. These impacts can cause flooding, erosion, and damage to infrastructure, homes, and livelihoods.
Opinion: Some policy makers believe that improving the resilience of the Marshall Islands is the most effective way to help its residents today.
Fact: Improving the resilience of the Marshall Islands involves implementing measures to help the islands adapt to the impacts of climate change, such as building seawalls, improving water management, and diversifying livelihoods. These measures can help to protect the islands and their residents from the immediate impacts of climate change.
Opinion: Focusing on resilience is an important step in helping the residents of the Marshall Islands today. However, it is also important to address the root causes of climate change and to work towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to prevent further impacts in the future. Let's not forget the importance of both adaptation and mitigation in addressing the impacts of climate change in vulnerable communities like the Marshall Islands."

And from 1940 to today, flood damage as a percentage of GDP has fallen to less than 0.05 per cent per year from about 0.2 per cent.","This is more or less a summary of the data cited in Pielke’s presentation and probably accurate. But as mentioned above, it does not give the whole picture. (1) The observational data for the US does not reflect changes in other regions. Heat waves in other regions can, for example, already be linked to climate change: “It is very likely that the number of cold days and nights has decreased and the number of warm days and nights has increased on the global scale. It is likely that the frequency of heat waves has increased in large parts of Europe, Asia and Australia. It is very likely that human influence has contributed to the observed global scale changes in the frequency and intensity of daily temperature extremes since the mid-20th century. It is likely that human influence has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of heat waves in some locations. (IPCC1) (2) The main argument for linking extreme weather with climate change comes from climate projections, which are completely omitted here. The IPCC special report on the 1.5 degree target2 is very clear in stating that a global warming of 2 degrees will lead to more extreme events than global warming of 1.5 degrees: “Climate models project robust differences in regional climate between present-day and global warming up to 1.5°C, and between 1.5°C and 2°C (high confidence), depending on the variable and region in question (high confidence). Large, robust and widespread differences are expected for temperature extremes (high confidence).” and “Limiting global warming to 1.5°C would limit risks of increases in heavy precipitation events on a global scale and in several regions compared to conditions at 2°C global warming (medium confidence). ” These are only summary statements, but detailed elaboration is given within the report. 1 – IPCC (2013) Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis 2 – IPCC (2018) Global Warming of 1.5 °C ",Train,Cherry Picking,"Title: ""Trends and Patterns in Extreme Weather Events""

"“But as that upper layer warms up, the oxygen-rich waters are less likely to mix down into cooler layers of the ocean because the warm waters are less dense and do not sink as readily.”","Enhanced stratification of the water column is indeed one mechanism that can explain the decrease in subsurface oxygen, notably in the tropics[1]. As the upper-layer of the ocean warms faster than the deeper layers, the temperature stratification increases, with the already-warm upper layer getting warmer. This enhanced thermal stratification acts as a barrier to vertical mixing, since warmer water is less dense (like when a low density fluid (e.g. oil) tops a high density fluid (e.g. water)). This stratification can prevent oxygen coming from the surface from reaching deeper layers where it gets depleted by biological activity (respiration). As climate change proceeds, the upper-ocean layer is also expected to become fresher (less salty) in the tropics as rainfall increase, further increasing the upper-ocean stratification[2].

Fact: Climate science is a field of ongoing research and discovery, and scientists are always seeking to learn more about the Earth's climate and its response to various factors. However, there is a strong scientific consensus on certain key issues based on a large body of evidence and research. Let's not spread misinformation about the nature of climate science and the pursuit of knowledge."
"“Sea ice thickness also substantially declined in the latter half of the 20th century, the snow and ice data center said.”","This is an important change to emphasize because sea ice thickness is also an indicator of sea ice age. While thin sea ice can reform more quickly year to year, thick sea ice requires more time. The loss of thick sea ice is perhaps even more striking than the loss of ice area.",Train,No Fallacy,"Title: ""Declining Sea Ice Thickness""
Fact: Sea ice thickness is an important indicator of the health of the Arctic and Antarctic regions. As the Earth's climate warms, sea ice is melting and becoming thinner, which can have significant impacts on the ecosystems and communities that depend on these regions.
Myth: Some people believe that sea ice thickness has not declined in recent decades.
Fallacy: There is no evidence to support this claim. In fact, scientific studies have shown that sea ice thickness has declined substantially in the latter half of the 20th century due to climate change.
Fact: Sea ice thickness has declined substantially in recent decades due to climate change. This decline has significant implications for the health of the Arctic and Antarctic regions and the ecosystems and communities that depend on them. Let's not spread misinformation about the impacts of climate change on sea ice thickness."
“Global human emissions are only 3 per cent of total annual emissions.”,"Global human emissions are indeed only a small percentage of what ecosystems cycle, but the reasoning is completely flawed. Regarding the impact on climate, it is the net emissions that matter, not the amount of carbon that is being cycled over and over. Terrestrial ecosystems take up and re-emit about 12 times more CO2 than humans emit, and oceans cycle about 9 times more CO2 than we emit. BUT! This carbon uptake and release is more or less balanced at the annual scale, and net ecosystem emissions are even negative. Without these ecosystems, atmospheric CO2 concentration would have risen even more as a consequence of fossil fuel burning; the CO2 concentration in the air would already be around 550 ppm (instead of the current ~400 ppm). Hence, it is absolutely misleading to compare amounts of CO2 cycling through the ecosystems with human CO2 emissions in this context. If anything, the CO2 cycling through the ecosystems should be taken as a reason to safeguard them: if we lose these carbon sinks, CO2 in the air will increase no matter what we do.",Test,Red Herring,"Title: ""Human Emissions and Climate Change""
Fact: Human activities, such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, contribute to the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). These greenhouse gases trap heat and warm the Earth's surface, leading to climate change.
Myth: Some people believe that global human emissions are only 3% of total annual emissions and therefore cannot significantly contribute to climate change.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false equivalence, as it equates the absolute amount of human emissions to the total annual emissions without considering the relative impact of these emissions. In reality, even though human emissions may be a smaller percentage of total annual emissions, they have a significant impact on the Earth's climate due to their greenhouse gas effect.
Fact: Human emissions, although a smaller percentage of total annual emissions, have a significant impact on the Earth's climate due to their greenhouse gas effect. It is important to address human emissions in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Let's not spread misinformation about the impact of human emissions on climate change."
as continents rise after the overlying ice has melted,"Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA) also causes subsidence of the solid Earth surface in the regions located outside the margins of the former ice sheets (for instance, along the U.S. East coast, where GIA-related subsidence is exacerbating the effects of global mean sea level rise).",Train,False Cause,"Title: ""Post-Ice Age Continents""
Fact: During the last Ice Age, large portions of the Earth's surface were covered in ice sheets that were several kilometers thick. As the climate warmed and the ice sheets melted, the weight of the ice was removed from the continents, causing them to rise up.
Myth: Some people believe that continents rise during the Ice Age and sink when the ice melts.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false cause, as it suggests that the presence or absence of ice directly causes the continents to rise or sink. In reality, the movements of the continents are caused by complex geological processes that are influenced by a variety of factors, including the distribution of mass on the Earth's surface and the activity of tectonic plates.
Fact: Continents do not rise during the Ice Age and sink when the ice melts. Instead, the weight of the overlying ice causes the continents to depress, and they rise up again as the ice melts and the weight is removed. However, the movements of the continents are influenced by a variety of factors and are not directly caused by the presence or absence of ice. Let's not spread misinformation about the geological processes that shape our planet."
"“There is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record. Ice in the Arctic and Antarctic melted to record low levels in January, scientists reported this week.”","One has to bear in mind that the seasonal developments of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice are out of phase by ~6 months. Hence, the Earth’s “total” sea ice extent is a number with limited meaning, and is not directly obvious to interpret. In addition, this number smooths out regional variations, which can be particularly pronounced in the Antarctic. Nevertheless, just like global-mean temperature or the GDP of a country, this number can be useful to have a 0th-order view on the health and state of our planet.",Train,Hasty Generalization,"Title: ""Record Low Sea Ice Levels""
Fact: Scientists have reported that there is now less sea ice on Earth than at any time on record. Both the Arctic and Antarctic have seen record low levels of ice in recent years, which is a significant concern for the health of the planet.
Myth: There are some people who deny that sea ice levels are at a record low, despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of denying evidence, as it ignores the significant body of scientific research and data that demonstrates the record low levels of sea ice. Denying this evidence can have serious consequences for the planet and our future.
Fact: The record low levels of sea ice are a significant concern for the health of the planet and the well-being of human communities around the world. It is important to acknowledge and address this issue through evidence-based policies and actions. Let's not spread misinformation or deny the overwhelming evidence on this critical issue."
the first scientists to show that the thick icecap that once covered the Arctic ocean was beginning to thin and shrink.”,"This is a misleading term. Ice caps are technically large land-based glaciers, whereas I think ‘Arctic icecaps’ here mean Arctic sea ice.  ",Test,Vagueness,"Title: ""The Arctic Ice Cap and Climate Change""
Fact: The Arctic ice cap is a large mass of ice that covers the Arctic Ocean and surrounding areas. In recent decades, the Arctic ice cap has been shrinking and thinning due to the effects of climate change.
Myth: Some people believe that the shrinking and thinning of the Arctic ice cap is not due to climate change.
Fallacy: This myth is based on the logical fallacy of a false cause, as it suggests that the shrinking and thinning of the Arctic ice cap is due to factors other than climate change. In reality, the scientific consensus is that the shrinking and thinning of the Arctic ice cap is largely due to the effects of climate change.
Fact: The scientific consensus is that the shrinking and thinning of the Arctic ice cap is largely due to the effects of climate change.
